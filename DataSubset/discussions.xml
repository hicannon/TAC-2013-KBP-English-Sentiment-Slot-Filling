Will US Troops Fire On US Citizens?

[With recent reports that Homeland Security has ordered the delivery of 450,000,000 hollow point bullets for its use, more than one bullet for every man woman and child alive today in this country, with Barack Obama, the Office Of White House Communications, mediamatters, and especially MSNBC's Al Sharpton busily trying to orchestrate and foment a Race War bringing about Barack's very own "Reichstag Fire Moment" when he can suspend the Constitution and remove the irritation, chafing and constraints the Bill of Rights places upon him, this is a pertinent question.]

"Who would believe that in the year 2012 one would have to ask if the U.S. Military would fire on American Citizen?s?

The question of troop involvement in a possible upcoming Martial Law scenario that is being predicted is no imaginary possibility ? nor is it a ?conspiracy theory?.

Many readers will recall the survey given to U.S. Marines at the 29 Palms Marine Corps base in California.

The survey asked the respondents to consider the following statement: ?I would fire upon U.S. citizens who refuse or resist confiscation of firearms banned by the United States government.?

The current situation is even more alarming, for example:

The passing of the NDAA, the National Defense Authorization Act of 2012, which THEBLAZE covers in an article titled, ?Can the ?Indefinite Detention? Bill Send Americans to Military Prison Without Trial?? (12-08-11) has caused even the most skeptic to be concerned for their personal safety ? especially those fighting for liberty.

The National Defense Resources Preparedness: Comparing Previous Executive Orders article that theintelhub.com posted online is another example of the emergence of a Fascist Police State taking complete control.

Lastly, the purchase by the Department of Homeland Security of 450,000,000 rounds of ammunition over a five year period should be warning enough that something is definitely wrong.

Who are these rounds to be used on? Even at 80,000,000 rounds per year, that?s one bullet for every dissenter at a minimum."

As incompetent as Janet Reno was, she wasn't responsible for Waco, any more than the attorney general of the time was responsible for Jonestown.

When these kinds of "I am God" cults form, everyone who joins is already dead. They are just waiting for the order. Eventually these madmen demand that their followers die to prove their belief and devotion. Waco is no different from Jonestown or from Heaven's Gate.

Quite possibly; but, what IF this or any other president decides to say, suspend the constitution-what then? Crawl, or take a side? All I know, is that the oath I took was to the constitution, not the country, not the president, not the army, so I guess that would put me on the side opposing anyone who suspended or violated it.

Every military member in every service is taught in basic training to obey lawful orders, failure to do so means a punitive action can be taken against you, up to and including a court-martial and a possible prison term, depending on the circumstances. But the key word in all that is LAWFUL; the military are not expected to be automatons, indiscriminately killing somebody just cuz somebody else told 'em to.

Should the military be called on in cases of emergency to quell violence and restore order, I am certain that the rules of engagement will be clear, and everyone will know what to do under whatever the circumstances might be. Every soldier will know that, so if the situation demands it they will do their duty. If that means firing on US citizens, then yes, they will do it.

And since Sept. 11, 2001, the number of immigrants in uniform who have become U.S. citizens has increased from 750 in 2001 to almost 4,600 last year, according to military statistics.

With severe manpower strains because of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan -- and a mandate to expand the overall size of the military -- the Pentagon is under pressure to consider a variety of proposals involving foreign recruits, according to a military affairs analyst.

<a href="http://www.military.com/news/article/2011/fbi-says-gangs-infiltrating-the-us-military.html">FBI Says Gangs Infiltrating the US Military</a>

The U.S. military is facing a "significant criminal threat" from gangs, including prison and biker gangs, whose members have found their way into the ranks, according to an FBI-led investigation.

Some gang members get into the military to escape the streets, but then end up reconnecting once in, while others target the services specifically for the combat and weapons training, the National Gang Intelligence Center says in a just-released 2011 National Gang Threat Assessment/Emerging Trends.

<a href="http://www.military.com/news/article/2011/fbi-says-gangs-infiltrating-the-us-military.html">FBI Says Gangs Infiltrating the US Military</a>

The U.S. military is facing a "significant criminal threat" from gangs, including prison and biker gangs, whose members have found their way into the ranks, according to an FBI-led investigation.

Some gang members get into the military to escape the streets, but then end up reconnecting once in, while others target the services specifically for the combat and weapons training, the National Gang Intelligence Center says in a just-released 2011 National Gang Threat Assessment/Emerging Trends.

FYI - the military does allow non-citizens to enlist in the military. But they must attain citizenship or they cannot re-enlist, and so their influence is quite minimal. And let me say this further about them and the gangbangers and such: the military has some bad people in it, as we've seen in the news every so often. Most get weeded out in basic training, you either conform or you get kicked out for the most part. Trust me, those TIs are good at finding and eliminating the malcontents, although a few do get through. But the foreigners, the gangbangers, the bad element, guys know who they're sharing a foxhole with, or who the guys are in their outfit that they can trust and who they can't. Doesn't matter what their background is, it's not like ordinary natural Americans don't have problems too. So this issue is making a mountainout of a very small molehill.

What you say is true; my problem is with Desperado's assertion that the troops wouldn't think twice about firing on American citizens. Yeah, they would, I hope we never put them in a position to face that situation. I do not appreciate the notion that US soldiers would easily open fire with no qualms about it.

</quote>

Our way of mocking the way some of his young followers almost deified him in the last campaign. To me, he's an empty suit, a younger, more eloquent version of John Kerry, a Liberal ideologue and political hack who has never held a real job-just an academic and community activist who stands for everything I despise politically, and not very much that I am for politically. We see him like your side saw Bush. Personally I see him as another Ivy League, intellectual snob (I never have yet met one I liked); a permanent civilian, who never served his country (Ivy Leaguers consider themselves too good for that), who never learned the first thing about discipline, leadership or respect, much less courage; and in recent times, a pompous ass as well. In short, I don't like the man, as a president, or as a person; not someone I'd care to share a drink and conversation with, under any circumstances. I don't have any problem figuring out that someone who refers to people like me as "the enemy" is in fact, my enemy. I'll support him beyond the water's edge out of respect for the office; but I will oppose him here at home and do all I can to defeat him in November.

Yup, like I said our Troops currently serving never had to fire upon crowds of their fellow citizens, to say they would just do it and not care is bullshit.

First, the only way that martial law would be declared would be a national disaster such as the eruption of Yellowstone, or a nuclear exchange with a major nation. Other than that, it is all in you wingnuts imaginaton.

Second, for there to be a major event where you wound have troops firing on citizens, you would have to have something like one of the fringe lunatic militias occupy a town and shooting citizens.

The miners were opposed by a well-armed contingent of mine guards and State Police with rifles and machine guns. These would eventually be joined by 2,000 U.S. Army troops armed with airplanes, bombs, and poison gas. The two forces met at Blair Mountain, in Logan County. The coal company forces held fortified positions along the ridge; the miners labored in the heat of late summer to climb the mountain with hopes of engaging company forces at the summit.

Waco wasn't a "massacre". What it was..was a travesty. How they let a Christian Terrorist Pedophile, like David Koresh yammer on for several months is beyond me.

And why some conservatives defend that piece of fucking shit..is pathetic.

In general, you don't use the military for civilian peacekeeping because the military trains its soldiers to use lethal force. If faced with resistance, the training kicks in and that's that. I don't blame soldiers for that, it's just how they're trained.

Holding government officials unaccountable for crimes they commit against the American public seems to be a growing trend the last few administrations. Of course, this latest
abberation absolutely takes the cake. The obama administration has taken abuse of the citizens to a high art form, shredding the Constitution and the Rule of Law savagely and continuously.
Personally, I doubt this administration will trust American troops to follow orders to the extent of firing on their own. We've seen information that indicates this administration considers military veterans as potential terrorists. Unless he segregates the troops and garrisons troops of different ethnicity in neighborhoods to be controlled. With the level of racial tension this CinC is fostering and fomenting, that would be one way to get Americans to fire on other Americans. The other possibility is that this administration declares marshal law and invites the UN to send troops.

There's an argument to be made that the Spanish-American War, where we finished taking away all of Spain's toys, was the point where we became a super power.

We weren't a superpower coming out of the Revolutionary War. A lot of the Founders were legitimately concerned we'd collapse quickly. We damn near did in the War of 1812.

Law enforcement was in an impossible situation in Waco, one in which the parents of those children put themselves in. It's analogous to when a police officer finds themselves in a hostage situation where a parent, out of their mind, has a gun on the kids. You know the parent is unstable and could shoot the kids at any time, and you also know that if you act, you risk the kids getting shot. So what's the right choice? Wait and hope reason prevails or act and hope you can move fast enough to save the kids?

I don't think anyone would say that Waco was a perfect example of law enforcement, but considering that it was the cult that precipitated and continued the stand off when they could have stood down at any time, I'm not that sympathetic for the adults involved. Take a shot at a cop or a soldier and don't be surprised when they shoot right back.

The kids though... that is a tragedy. Goddamn wacko parents that put their kids in situations like that.

[With recent reports that Homeland Security has ordered the delivery of 450,000,000 hollow point bullets for its use, more than one bullet for every man woman and child alive today in this country, with Barack Obama, the Office Of White House Communications, mediamatters, and especially MSNBC's Al Sharpton busily trying to orchestrate and foment a Race War bringing about Barack's very own "Reichstag Fire Moment" when he can suspend the Constitution and remove the irritation, chafing and constraints the Bill of Rights places upon him, this is a pertinent question.]

"Who would believe that in the year 2012 one would have to ask if the U.S. Military would fire on American Citizen’s?

The question of troop involvement in a possible upcoming Martial Law scenario that is being predicted is no imaginary possibility – nor is it a ‘conspiracy theory’.

Many readers will recall the survey given to U.S. Marines at the 29 Palms Marine Corps base in California.

The survey asked the respondents to consider the following statement: “I would fire upon U.S. citizens who refuse or resist confiscation of firearms banned by the United States government.”

The current situation is even more alarming, for example:

The passing of the NDAA, the National Defense Authorization Act of 2012, which THEBLAZE covers in an article titled, “Can the ‘Indefinite Detention’ Bill Send Americans to Military Prison Without Trial?” (12-08-11) has caused even the most skeptic to be concerned for their personal safety – especially those fighting for liberty.

The National Defense Resources Preparedness: Comparing Previous Executive Orders article that theintelhub.com posted online is another example of the emergence of a Fascist Police State taking complete control.

Lastly, the purchase by the Department of Homeland Security of 450,000,000 rounds of ammunition over a five year period should be warning enough that something is definitely wrong.

Who are these rounds to be used on? Even at 80,000,000 rounds per year, that’s one bullet for every dissenter at a minimum."

"Will US Troops Fire On US Citizens?"
if ii could make bloody letter too.

Hmm? I hope so, this how to impose “rights” on the people
Hopefully for the last time! In this manner. btw is it not less then 400m w/ illegals so we need more ammo?

First of all, Marines would not be involved in engaging gun nuts screaming "from my cold dead fingers" it is not their mission. ATF agents and local authorities would handle it

As a gun owner, you have a constitutional right to own weapons. You do not have a constitutional right to kill people trying to take your weapon. If authorities come to your door claiming you have an illegal weapon, you are required to turn it over. Your Constitutional rights are to get a lawyer and prove your second amendment rights have been violated

If you choose to shoot it out with law enforcement over your rights to own guns.....you are a criminal
The same as a drug dealer shooting it out trying to protect his turf

I think it's worth pointing out the larger principle here which is this:

Even if your rights are being violated, once you make a decision to use violence against law enforcement officials, even if they are in the wrong, you likely won't live to make your case in a court of law.

That's just how it is. Once bullets are flying the only folks that care about your Constitutional rights are your heirs who will be profiting from the lawsuit they file with the cops.

That's even more true if you're in a scenario where the US Military is being used to enforce the law. There aren't many folks out there that can say they started a firefight with a Marine because most of the folks stupid enough to do so are now dead. Just because you're a civilian doesn't mean they won't respond with overwhelming force of you start crap.

GOP News Flash: The real reason for soaring gas prices
</headline>
<post author="earthling01" datetime="2012-03-17T12:16:00" id="p1">
There has been a lot of blame for oil prices on President Obama lately.
The GOP needs to emphasize this point in order to sway voters.

But when we look at the facts, there are simply too many speculators profiting from soaring gas prices. In short, the massive oil corporations and Hedge Fund managers are the real culprits. Here is a document leaked from 2008:

<a href="http://www.slideshare.net/lee_fang/energy-holdingswticrudeoil">Energy holdings-wti-crude-oil</a>

There is a deliberate effort to inflate the already outrageous prices of refined crude. Rick Ungar of Forbes magazine (not a flaming liberal rag, mind you) explains that refineries have been systematically shutting down in order to reduce national supply and jack up prices. Moreover, we see oil producers looking to sell domestic oil in foreign markets in order to boost demand. Not that there is anything illegal about that, but it certainly isn't helping out the American consumers by artificially increasing demand and reducing supply when we need the stuff to get to work and to get the economy back on track.

<a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/rickungar/2012/03/17/the-truth-about-obama-oil-and-the-gasoline-blame-game-part-two/">The Truth About Obama, Oil And The Gasoline Blame Game-Part Two - Forbes</a>

Congressman Peter Welch (D-VT) tells how apprx 50 cents on each gallon of gasoline purchased goes to speculators rather than to refinement and production costs. That's about $15 going to Banking industry like Goldman Sachs every time you fill your tank!

<a href="http://welch.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1930:after-rumors-send-oil-prices-falling-welch-renews-call-on-president-to-tap-nations-oil-reserves&amp;catid=41:2012-press-releases&amp;Itemid=32">After rumors send oil prices falling, Welch renews call on President to tap nation's oil reserves</a>

Nevertheless, the GOP is still calling for less govt regulation in banking and oil industries. In spite of the evidence to the contrary, some of us continue to blame Obama for the lack of and real conviction to control rising prices.

If anything, this sets the stage for MORE govt regulation, not less. Unless, of course, everyone is happy with gas prices where they are currently.

Yep, this is free market Capitalism at its best. And you can sure as hell expect more of this if the GOP (aka "Frontmen for the Oil Industry") ever take back the White House.

2008? isn't that when the Democrats were blaming Booooosh and Cheney and Halliburton for higher gasoline prices? You remember, when the price was $1.87/gallon.

Speculators make bets on whether or not the price of any commodity will go up or down. The price of Gas is based largely on geo political forces and right now the Iranians are threatening to close the Straight of Hormuz effectively cutting back the work's supply of oil by about 1/5.

The mere threat of a shortage has caused the price to rise by about.50/gallon. A real shortage would cause a spike unlike anything ever seen. Of course this is the wet dream of the Big 0's administration.

You know what else? If Americans go to the pumps and there is no gas, they will demand that we get gas and they will not care what has to happen to get it.

PAY ATTENTION (and you might learn something):

This is why you pay what you pay for gasoline:

U.S. exported more gasoline than imported last year

For the first time since 1949, the United States exported more gasoline, heating oil and diesel fuel last year than it imported, the Energy Department reported today.

Bloomberg writes that to offset weak U.S. demand, refiners exported 439,000 barrels a day more than were imported the year before. In 2010, daily imports averaged 269,000 barrels, according to the Petroleum Supply Monthly report.

Imports of crude oil and related products fell 11% last year, reaching a level not seen since 1995.

News of record gasoline exports comes as the pump price rose today for the 22nd straight day ($3.78 a gallon average) and the Energy Department reported separately that gasoline inventories fell last week while crude oil inventories and imports rose.

You are paying what you pay for gasoline because you are competing for it with the rest of the world.

U.S. refiners simply sell to whoever will pay them the best price, all things considered. If you won't pay 4 bucks a gallon for it, they'll sell it to someone who will.

btw, keep that in mind when you're foolishly thinking that the Keystone pipeline bringing oil to US refiners is going to magically lower gasoline prices...

...they'll sell THAT to the highest bidder too.

</quote>

Did I say that? I have said on this and other boards Presidents can't control gas prices i did not blame Bush for high gas prices and I don't blame Obama for them but the left was more than happy to lay the blame for them on Bush for political gain so I really have no problem with the right doing the same thing to Obama for the same reason.

There has been a lot of blame for oil prices on President Obama lately.
The GOP needs to emphasize this point in order to sway voters.

But when we look at the facts, there are simply too many speculators profiting from soaring gas prices. In short, the massive oil corporations and Hedge Fund managers are the real culprits. Here is a document leaked from 2008:

<a href="http://www.slideshare.net/lee_fang/energy-holdingswticrudeoil">Energy holdings-wti-crude-oil</a>

There is a deliberate effort to inflate the already outrageous prices of refined crude. Rick Ungar of Forbes magazine (not a flaming liberal rag, mind you) explains that refineries have been systematically shutting down in order to reduce national supply and jack up prices. Moreover, we see oil producers looking to sell domestic oil in foreign markets in order to boost demand. Not that there is anything illegal about that, but it certainly isn't helping out the American consumers by artificially increasing demand and reducing supply when we need the stuff to get to work and to get the economy back on track.

<a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/rickungar/2012/03/17/the-truth-about-obama-oil-and-the-gasoline-blame-game-part-two/">The Truth About Obama, Oil And The Gasoline Blame Game-Part Two - Forbes</a>

Congressman Peter Welch (D-VT) tells how apprx 50 cents on each gallon of gasoline purchased goes to speculators rather than to refinement and production costs. That's about $15 going to Banking industry like Goldman Sachs every time you fill your tank!

<a href="http://welch.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1930:after-rumors-send-oil-prices-falling-welch-renews-call-on-president-to-tap-nations-oil-reserves&amp;catid=41:2012-press-releases&amp;Itemid=32">After rumors send oil prices falling, Welch renews call on President to tap nation's oil reserves</a>

Nevertheless, the GOP is still calling for less govt regulation in banking and oil industries. In spite of the evidence to the contrary, some of us continue to blame Obama for the lack of and real conviction to control rising prices.

If anything, this sets the stage for MORE govt regulation, not less. Unless, of course, everyone is happy with gas prices where they are currently.

Yep, this is free market Capitalism at its best. And you can sure as hell expect more of this if the GOP (aka "Frontmen for the Oil Industry") ever take back the White House.

</quote>

I didn't need to read any further than this in the Forbes article you linked to know you that intentionally or unintentionally, you are presenting a questionable thesis here:

<quote>
But to suggest that the refinery closures, over these many years, are the result of government regulations—EPA or otherwise—is ridiculous. They closed because the higher prices of oil combined with the lowered demand for oil worked to make these refineries unprofitable for their owners.

</quote>

I didn't think Ungar would be one to suggest oil companies are closing refineries to 'jack up prices' which you posted. And he didn't.

If you read other articles he has written, it is true that EPA regulations are not forcing existing refineries to close (though those same EPA regulations ARE jacking up the price of gasoline), but EPA regulations among other factors are making it highly unattractive for oil companies to attempt to build new refineries in an environment of socioeconomic uncertainties such as are created by the threat of Cap &amp; Trade, continued unrest in the Middle East, etc. etc. etc.

There are so many factors going into the price of a gallon of gasoline at the pump, that no single one can be blamed for it all. It is very true that Obama is not to blame for the high price of oil and/or high prices at the pump. But it is also true that the Obama administration has done little or nothing to allieviate the situation and has made it worse by its policy in our own Gulf of Mexico and other coastal waters, nixing the pipeline, and doing nothing to alleviate fears re regulations still overing overhead. A few cents here, a few cents there, eventually adds up to a dollar and a savings of $10.00 to $20.00 or more at the pump. And that factors into everything we buy that is manufactured using petroleum products or transported by machines using petroleum products. Obama gets most of his campaign contributions from Wall Street so he is unlikely to rock the boat in the futures market which could easily be done in the interest of the general welfare to rein in speculators that are hurting us all.

You have to approach it from a macroeconomics perspective, not a single issue perspective.

Ten years ago, the call to open up ANWR and the Bakkan fields, etc. were met with objections that we wouldn't see any difference in supply or at the pump for at least ten years. Well, it is now ten years later. If we had done it then, we would be better off now. But we're still hearing the same arguments. It will take too long to accomplish improvements when we need the relief now, so we won't do the improvements.

If the government ever did get it right so that the oil companies had to go back to work to make a profit and expand, we would see a dramatic improvement in a relatively short time.

Good find., But the fact is, high gas prices are not Obama's fault. It IS his fault that he hasn't done anything practical to move us toward more energy independence and in fact has thrown up some roadblocks toward that goal.

PAY ATTENTION (and you might learn something):

This is why you pay what you pay for gasoline:

U.S. exported more gasoline than imported last year

For the first time since 1949, the United States exported more gasoline, heating oil and diesel fuel last year than it imported, the Energy Department reported today.

Bloomberg writes that to offset weak U.S. demand, refiners exported 439,000 barrels a day more than were imported the year before. In 2010, daily imports averaged 269,000 barrels, according to the Petroleum Supply Monthly report.

Imports of crude oil and related products fell 11% last year, reaching a level not seen since 1995.

News of record gasoline exports comes as the pump price rose today for the 22nd straight day ($3.78 a gallon average) and the Energy Department reported separately that gasoline inventories fell last week while crude oil inventories and imports rose.

You are paying what you pay for gasoline because you are competing for it with the rest of the world.

U.S. refiners simply sell to whoever will pay them the best price, all things considered. If you won't pay 4 bucks a gallon for it, they'll sell it to someone who will.

btw, keep that in mind when you're foolishly thinking that the Keystone pipeline bringing oil to US refiners is going to magically lower gasoline prices...

...they'll sell THAT to the highest bidder too.

Like I said, read it again. Read it until you understand it.

The refineries are producing so much gas they can export it at good profit and still meet US demand.

Americans are willing to pay the price on the pump, so why would a gas station lower it?

Especially, why would a seller of gas lower the price to Americans when foreign buyers will pay better?

</quote>

Maybe not a fix, but it can be helped in a number of ways. Something the government could do right now that would help:

1) Negotiate a deal with the oil companies to lower gasoline prices in the USA in return for no export fees or other costs that would reduce their profits in overseas markets.

2) Negotiate with the states to agree on one uniform formula for regular and premium gasoline sold throughout in the USA. When Kansas regs require one formula and California regs require another formula and Illinois requires still another, the refineries have to shut down much more frequently to retool and reformulate the gasoline.

3) Get rid of the refining mandates that most or all sulfur be removed from diesel fuel. Sulfur emissions had been steadily declining since 1980 and were down around 70% when the new mandate went into effect. Why the mandate? Because the EPA thought catalytic converter efficiency MIGHT be affected by high sulfur content in diesel. They didn't even bother to find out if that would be the case. So, instead of leaving it to the auto parts manufacture to come up with an efficient catalytic converter, they added about $1.00 to the price of a gallon of diesel with a mandate that the refineries remove the sulfur, a very expensive process.

4) Get rid of the ridiculous inclusion of ethanol in motor fuels and return food crops to food for livestock and the kitchen table,.

Speculators see Obamination constantly preventing more drilling in the US, thus they project higher oil prices in the long term.

You assholes prevent drilling going back decades but then claim drilling now won't affect "today's price." Well, what you did before and what you do now does affect today's price and tomorrow's price because we know you are trying to limit supply to drive everyone into fairy dust cars.

There has been a lot of blame for oil prices on President Obama lately.
The GOP needs to emphasize this point in order to sway voters.

But when we look at the facts, there are simply too many speculators profiting from soaring gas prices. In short, the massive oil corporations and Hedge Fund managers are the real culprits. Here is a document leaked from 2008:

<a href="http://www.slideshare.net/lee_fang/energy-holdingswticrudeoil">Energy holdings-wti-crude-oil</a>

There is a deliberate effort to inflate the already outrageous prices of refined crude. Rick Ungar of Forbes magazine (not a flaming liberal rag, mind you) explains that refineries have been systematically shutting down in order to reduce national supply and jack up prices. Moreover, we see oil producers looking to sell domestic oil in foreign markets in order to boost demand. Not that there is anything illegal about that, but it certainly isn't helping out the American consumers by artificially increasing demand and reducing supply when we need the stuff to get to work and to get the economy back on track.

PAY ATTENTION (and you might learn something):

This is why you pay what you pay for gasoline:

U.S. exported more gasoline than imported last year

For the first time since 1949, the United States exported more gasoline, heating oil and diesel fuel last year than it imported, the Energy Department reported today.

Bloomberg writes that to offset weak U.S. demand, refiners exported 439,000 barrels a day more than were imported the year before. In 2010, daily imports averaged 269,000 barrels, according to the Petroleum Supply Monthly report.

Imports of crude oil and related products fell 11% last year, reaching a level not seen since 1995.

News of record gasoline exports comes as the pump price rose today for the 22nd straight day ($3.78 a gallon average) and the Energy Department reported separately that gasoline inventories fell last week while crude oil inventories and imports rose.

You are paying what you pay for gasoline because you are competing for it with the rest of the world.

U.S. refiners simply sell to whoever will pay them the best price, all things considered. If you won't pay 4 bucks a gallon for it, they'll sell it to someone who will.

btw, keep that in mind when you're foolishly thinking that the Keystone pipeline bringing oil to US refiners is going to magically lower gasoline prices...

...they'll sell THAT to the highest bidder too.

<a href="http://content.usatoday.com/communities/ondeadline/post/2012/02/us-exported-more-gasoline-than-imported-last-year/1">U.S. exported more gasoline than imported last year</a>

Don't get it? Read it again, and again, until you do.

That is the most imcomprehensible part of the Obama energy policy. He won't let U.S. oil companies drill in the gulf and allowed all those off shore rigs go to other countries and we'll have hell to pay to ever get them back. This has cost us millions of barrels of oil and I think thousands of jobs in some of our poorest states that really needed those jobs. And he has further targeted the oil companies, alone among industries, with significantly higher taxes.

But we're subsidzing countries like Columbia, Brazil, Venezuela, and Mexico who are drilling for oil in the Gulf as well as importing oil from them. (And who got those rigs that the Obama administration wouldn't allow here.) And the government didn't say boo to the Russians who recently announced they plan to do some drilling in the Gulf of Mexico.

I recommend that everybody listen to that ad one more time before reading this written in May 2010:

<quote>
While the BP oil geyser pumps millions of gallons of petroleum into the Gulf of Mexico, President Barack Obama and members of Congress may have to answer for the millions in campaign contributions they’ve taken from the oil and gas giant over the years.

BP and its employees have given more than $3.5 million to federal candidates over the past 20 years, with the largest chunk of their money going to Obama, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Donations come from a mix of employees and the company’s political action committees — $2.89 million flowed to campaigns from BP-related PACs and about $638,000 came from individuals.

I'd much rather they put a little control on the EPA.

</quote>

Why?

There is so much gasoline being produced in the US that refineries are exporting it, and Americans are WILLING to pay 4 bucks a gallon.

How do YOU fix that?

</quote>

Maybe not a fix, but it can be helped in a number of ways. Something the government could do right now that would help:

1) Negotiate a deal with the oil companies to lower gasoline prices in the USA in return for no export fees or other costs that would reduce their profits in overseas markets.

2) Negotiate with the states to agree on one uniform formula for regular and premium gasoline sold throughout in the USA. When Kansas regs require one formula and California regs require another formula and Illinois requires still another, the refineries have to shut down much more frequently to retool and reformulate the gasoline.

3) Get rid of the refining mandates that most or all sulfur be removed from diesel fuel. Sulfur emissions had been steadily declining since 1980 and were down around 70% when the new mandate went into effect. Why the mandate? Because the EPA thought catalytic converter efficiency MIGHT be affected by high sulfur content in diesel. They didn't even bother to find out if that would be the case. So, instead of leaving it to the auto parts manufacture to come up with an efficient catalytic converter, they added about $1.00 to the price of a gallon of diesel for the refineries to remove the diesel.

4) Get rid of the ridiculous inclusion of ethanol in motor fuels and return food crops to food for livestock and the kitchen table,.

</quote>

None of that matters as long as the refineries have overseas buyers willing to pay these prices for gas. What do you think happens to gas prices as more and more Chinese, and Indians, for example, actually get to where they can afford a car?

Why?

There is so much gasoline being produced in the US that refineries are exporting it, and Americans are WILLING to pay 4 bucks a gallon.

How do YOU fix that?

</quote>

Maybe not a fix, but it can be helped in a number of ways. Something the government could do right now that would help:

1) Negotiate a deal with the oil companies to lower gasoline prices in the USA in return for no export fees or other costs that would reduce their profits in overseas markets.

2) Negotiate with the states to agree on one uniform formula for regular and premium gasoline sold throughout in the USA. When Kansas regs require one formula and California regs require another formula and Illinois requires still another, the refineries have to shut down much more frequently to retool and reformulate the gasoline.

3) Get rid of the refining mandates that most or all sulfur be removed from diesel fuel. Sulfur emissions had been steadily declining since 1980 and were down around 70% when the new mandate went into effect. Why the mandate? Because the EPA thought catalytic converter efficiency MIGHT be affected by high sulfur content in diesel. They didn't even bother to find out if that would be the case. So, instead of leaving it to the auto parts manufacture to come up with an efficient catalytic converter, they added about $1.00 to the price of a gallon of diesel for the refineries to remove the diesel.

4) Get rid of the ridiculous inclusion of ethanol in motor fuels and return food crops to food for livestock and the kitchen table,.

</quote>

None of that matters as long as the refineries have overseas buyers willing to pay these prices for gas. What do you think happens to gas prices as more and more Chinese, and Indians, for example, actually get to where they can afford a car?

</quote>

No. 1 on my list addresses that issues and could take care of it. The other issues are all costs that refineries have to add into the wholesale price of gasoline that the stations have to pass on plus some to cover the taxes and their profit. There is no shortage of domestic fuel supply. So lowering the cost for the manufacturer translates into a lower cost at the pump. A lower cost at the pump then generates more demand as people can afford to travel and drive for pleasure again, and the oil companies would enjoy profits from that too.

In the 1970's, there was supposedly a true gasoline shortage. Stations ran out of fuel and when a station did get a supply, there were long lines and long waits to get your car to the pump while you prayed that the station wouldn't run out of gas or your car wouldn't run out of gas before you got to the pump. That along with high prices for the fuel, high unemployment, double digit inflation, and double digit interest rates was a big reason Jimmy Carter was so thoroughly defeated in his re-election bid.

We are seeing no shortages of fuel anywhere right now. A much different dynamic is in effect.

Here's some very good debunking about the lies the right has been spreading about oil prices.

<a href="http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0312/74120.html">Gas price rhetoric pumps up the hype</a>

I loved this tidbit about how the Moonie Times and Weekly Standard tried to distort the story.

<quote>
D.C.-area residents are familiar with the insanely high prices of the Exxon station at the Watergate complex, which routinely charges as much as $1 a gallon more than other stations less than a mile away ? including a Sunoco across the street. So that makes it a magnet for news organizations or other groups shopping for a shocking price, especially one within walking distance of the White House.

Hence a blog item last month in The Washington Times, which cited the Exxon under the headline ?$5 gas hits D.C.?

Subsequently, The Weekly Standard featured a photo of the Exxon and its $5.39-a-gallon price, under the possibly satirical headline ?The Shocking Photo the Obama Administration Doesn't Want You to See.? That was followed by a similar item on the Glenn Beck-affiliated website The Blaze and a photo on The National Review?s website.

One dynamic is that economy standards have almost doubled on most average sedans, and quadrupled on hybrids. Our consumption of oil is down significantly from what it was in the '70s, in spite of population growth, and more cars on the road. Add to that the fact that our gas is blended with ethanol. I saw a figure that America now consumes about 5.3 million barrels a day. In the '70s we were over 8 million bbls/day.

The simple issue is that people in India and China, the two most populace countries, aren't traveling by bike as much these days. They're rapidly emerging, with a strong middle class, who want cars. Exxon, Mobil, Shell, BP could double their capacity, but they're going to sell at world prices. They're not in business to help Americans get cheap gas, they'll sell at what the market is willing to pay. Whether it's drilled here or in Saudi Arabia isn't going to change the price.

It won't change the price of a barrel of oil as that is set by the world market. But policy could change the price of a gallon of gasoline if the Administration wanted to help the American people. And they could do that with a policy that would provide the incentive for the oil companies to give the American people a break in return or making their profits on the world market.

The oil industry has not been a free market industry for decades now. It is among the most highly regulated industry in the country and the government does have the power to make a difference. But it has to be done in a way that profits everybody. Try to punish the oil industry without a reasonable offset and despite being under government control, the oil company does not have to play ball. The right and reasonable thing to do is find a win win situation for everybody.

Currently, the economists have all said that the Wall St. speculators have added 50-56 cents per gallon purchased because of their bullshit.

This summer, gas was at 3.20 here in Amarillo, subtract what Wall St. took in, and gas prices would have been around 2.64 to 2.70 if it wasn't for them.

How much has the devaluation of the dollar driven up prices? Got a link, or are you gonna have The "T"ard parrot your bullshit again for ya?

If I remember correctly....the oil companies only make around 10 cents a gallon on profit. There have been numerous congressional investigations to try and nail them for gouging, but for a couple of service stations gouging, they could never come up with anything.

These oil companies are huge...even the small ones like Exxon. Everybody uses gas....this is why they have huge profits. Not from price gouging

How much profit does the average oil company make on an average gallon of gas right now? The answer will surprise you ? $0.09.

Maybe you could follow up your '08 treatise by rendering an opinion on why oil prices fell by $100 in a 7 month time span.

Did the "speculator's bullshit" cause the crash in oil prices between June '08 to January '09?

There has been a lot of blame for oil prices on President Obama lately.
The GOP needs to emphasize this point in order to sway voters.

But when we look at the facts, there are simply too many speculators profiting from soaring gas prices. In short, the massive oil corporations and Hedge Fund managers are the real culprits. Here is a document leaked from 2008:

<a href="http://www.slideshare.net/lee_fang/energy-holdingswticrudeoil">Energy holdings-wti-crude-oil</a>

There is a deliberate effort to inflate the already outrageous prices of refined crude. Rick Ungar of Forbes magazine (not a flaming liberal rag, mind you) explains that refineries have been systematically shutting down in order to reduce national supply and jack up prices. Moreover, we see oil producers looking to sell domestic oil in foreign markets in order to boost demand. Not that there is anything illegal about that, but it certainly isn't helping out the American consumers by artificially increasing demand and reducing supply when we need the stuff to get to work and to get the economy back on track.

<a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/rickungar/2012/03/17/the-truth-about-obama-oil-and-the-gasoline-blame-game-part-two/">The Truth About Obama, Oil And The Gasoline Blame Game-Part Two - Forbes</a>

Congressman Peter Welch (D-VT) tells how apprx 50 cents on each gallon of gasoline purchased goes to speculators rather than to refinement and production costs. That's about $15 going to Banking industry like Goldman Sachs every time you fill your tank!

<a href="http://welch.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1930:after-rumors-send-oil-prices-falling-welch-renews-call-on-president-to-tap-nations-oil-reserves&amp;catid=41:2012-press-releases&amp;Itemid=32">After rumors send oil prices falling, Welch renews call on President to tap nation's oil reserves</a>

Nevertheless, the GOP is still calling for less govt regulation in banking and oil industries. In spite of the evidence to the contrary, some of us continue to blame Obama for the lack of and real conviction to control rising prices.

If anything, this sets the stage for MORE govt regulation, not less. Unless, of course, everyone is happy with gas prices where they are currently.

Yep, this is free market Capitalism at its best. And you can sure as hell expect more of this if the GOP (aka "Frontmen for the Oil Industry") ever take back the White House.

</quote>

Hmm. An opinion piece which favors the President's non existent energy policy and of course the expected hall pass.
Where was this when gas prices rose to $4 the first time? Nowhere. Your side blamed the Bush admin claiming both the President and the VP of deliberately sending prices higher to benefit "their rich oil company friends"...
You cannot have it both ways.
The fact is Obama is anti fossil fuels. His energy Secretary has been quoted many times he thinks gas prices here should be what they are in Western Europe.
Obama has dismissed any ideas to allow gas prices to settle. His answer to the people is " Americans must learn to use less gasoline"...
Now, the facts say that despite the liberal talking points listed above, the refining end of the oil business is very expensive here in the US. This is due to the layers of regulations and bureaucratic red tape.
BTW, just because an opinion piece appears in a publication that is perceived to not be biased ot the left, does not mean the piece cannot be of a liberal viewpoint.
The NY Times prints conservative viewpoints on occasion.

Because just like I'd rather hear from a legitimate doctor on medical issues, or would like to hear from a legitimate scientist on science issues, I'd like to hear about oil prices from someone who actually works in the business, instead of some physicist.

Would you trust Dr. Neil DeGrasse Tyson or Michio Kaku to tell you why gas prices are what they are? I wouldn't.

Oh yeah..........for uneducated people like you, those are 2 of the top physicists in the world.

My father was in the oil business for 30 years, ABS. I used to hammer on him about the profits and he showed me that they made around 10 cents a gallon profit. That was 30 years ago.

With more supply than demand it makes complete logical sense to cut back on production at refineries. It also then makes sense to sell in whatever market there is demand to reduce inventory; hence foreign purchasers.

The price of oil is not set by us oil companies, it's set by the world market based on world supply and commensurate demand and the speculators do not foresee an improvement. Instead they see a supply at risk because the largest player in the marketplace (the US) has no sensible strategy to stabilize the supply nor the demand. It instead touts substitute energy production many decades in the future, if ever, which the speculators view with no confidence.

As a matter of fact the high prices in oil both crude and refined hang on that lack of confidence. Add to that the threats by Iran, a major nation in the region seeking hegemonic supremacy, threatening closure of the shipping bottleneck, combined with a failure over time to deal rationally with that nation and the speculators bid up the price of oil according to the chaos they are seeing.

A new US congress and president taking office together in '13, with a believable policy announcement on US oil pruduction and a naval presence in the Persian Gulf to prevent any temporary closure would begin to settle the markets and wring the speculation out of the equation.

An American president whose best solution to high domestic gasoline prices is to threaten to take away Oil Company "tax breaks," which in reality are allowances for accelerated depreciation which are meant to encourage investment in costly exploration and equipment purchased or manufactured aimed at increasing the oil supply is seen by speculators as being counter-productive to stabilizing oil and gasoline prices.

Oh, and the refining capacity that is being taken off line is the least efficient available, and can't be made more efficient because of permitting requirements by the EPA.

The price of oil expressed in US dollars is not helped by weak dollars because of Fed policy the past three and half years. All commodity prices show that weakness.

Gasoline prices have dropped in California in the past few days for one simple and what should be a instructive reason; the switching from winter blend to summer blend - which will lower the price until elevated summer driving demand pushes it back up. This is being touted as a panacea.

All across America gasohol blends are mandated that actually lower automobile gas mileage, cost more than unblended gasoline because ethanol is much more costly to produce, is federally subsidized, burns dirtier, as well as adds direct costs for the blending process itself.

We have a system in chaos, with no logical controlling authority. This undermines confidence in positive expectations, exacerbates doubt, hence speculation that the situation can get worse before it gets better.

The American people understand WHO AND WHY the price of gas and oil are spiking.

Even the trolls on this board pretending they don't get it and trying to pin that blame on Obama, really understand it.

So debating this issue with those lying trolls is a basically a pointless exercise unless you're fond of watching people make partisan asses of themselves.

There has been a lot of blame for oil prices on President Obama lately.
The GOP needs to emphasize this point in order to sway voters.

But when we look at the facts, there are simply too many speculators profiting from soaring gas prices. In short, the massive oil corporations and Hedge Fund managers are the real culprits. Here is a document leaked from 2008:

<a href="http://www.slideshare.net/lee_fang/energy-holdingswticrudeoil">Energy holdings-wti-crude-oil</a>

There is a deliberate effort to inflate the already outrageous prices of refined crude. Rick Ungar of Forbes magazine (not a flaming liberal rag, mind you) explains that refineries have been systematically shutting down in order to reduce national supply and jack up prices. Moreover, we see oil producers looking to sell domestic oil in foreign markets in order to boost demand. Not that there is anything illegal about that, but it certainly isn't helping out the American consumers by artificially increasing demand and reducing supply when we need the stuff to get to work and to get the economy back on track.

<a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/rickungar/2012/03/17/the-truth-about-obama-oil-and-the-gasoline-blame-game-part-two/">The Truth About Obama, Oil And The Gasoline Blame Game-Part Two - Forbes</a>

Congressman Peter Welch (D-VT) tells how apprx 50 cents on each gallon of gasoline purchased goes to speculators rather than to refinement and production costs. That's about $15 going to Banking industry like Goldman Sachs every time you fill your tank!

<a href="http://welch.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1930:after-rumors-send-oil-prices-falling-welch-renews-call-on-president-to-tap-nations-oil-reserves&amp;catid=41:2012-press-releases&amp;Itemid=32">After rumors send oil prices falling, Welch renews call on President to tap nation's oil reserves</a>

Nevertheless, the GOP is still calling for less govt regulation in banking and oil industries. In spite of the evidence to the contrary, some of us continue to blame Obama for the lack of and real conviction to control rising prices.

If anything, this sets the stage for MORE govt regulation, not less. Unless, of course, everyone is happy with gas prices where they are currently.

Yep, this is free market Capitalism at its best. And you can sure as hell expect more of this if the GOP (aka "Frontmen for the Oil Industry") ever take back the White House.

Speculators due exactly that speculate and they take everything into consideration in order to make money so all the policies and uncertainty in the economy lead them to buy and sell - raise lower the price of oil ect so how can it not be placed on the current administration? After all its his policies and some other from before him.
Im sure if cap and trade were in place it would be alot higher...
Its called supply and demand so if we didnt need as much due to the fact that we have our own they would speculate down!

No one's willing to recognize the Federal Reserve's role in this? After the collapse in 2008 oil fell hard to $30/bbl. The Fed instituted several massive liquidity injections to buy junk MBS and reflate the economy, and then proceeded to utilize 2 separate rounds of quantitative easing. This inflated the monetary base to historic proportions and severely devalued the Dollar.

Ever since that, oil has continued to climb.

It's the DOLLAR.

To sum up the stupdity and lies by liberals on this subject...

When Bush was President and the price of gas rose, Democrats like Kerry went on TV saying Bush was allowing the Saudis to limit the world supply of oil to increse their profits. Meanwhile Bush with no power over the Saudis increased domestic drilling in the USA....but was still blamed for fairy dust stories regarding middle east oil.

When Obamination got into office, his EPA and Dept of the Interior goons slowed and even stopped drilling permits on Federal lands, even defying a Federal judge based in Louisiana to reopen drilling in the Gulf. His Dept of Energy idiot leader (white roads Chu) said he wanted $10/gallon gas in the USA, but then tried to cover it up at Congress hearings last week.

Of course, speculators that buy and sell future crud options see Obamination and his fellow goons driving up the price of oil with their policies, so they bet on rising oil prices.....

Oh, but this is alllllllllll Bush's fault.

You admit Canada adds more in taxes to their gas at the pump.....which drives up the cost, but then you wonder why their gas is higher than our gas price.

Canadian politicians and higher shipping costs add cents to dollars on their gas, so it costs more to get gas in Canada.

Obamination is helping drive up the cost of gas here by preventing drilling on Federal lands. The people that buy and sell future oil sales see Obamination limiting SUPPLY, so the price goes up.

Obamination is guilty of higher gas prices here just like the Canadian and English left-wing politicians are in their countries.

No actually we didn't. As one of the "silly libs" you are talking about, I always blamed the oil companies and speculators for the price of gas. If you look at polls from that time, most people DID NOT blame Bush.

Granted, more people blamed Bush than they blame Obama now, (but not by a large margin 25% to 18%) but that might have something to do with the fact that Bush was an oil man that started an unnecessary war in oil country...and was photographed kissing Saudi Oil princes.

Too stupid to know how to click on the link I provided? What a moron.

</quote>

I wasn't too stupid to click on the link and read the honest assessment that the big spike in gasoline prices in the Bush administration was due to Katrina and most of the Gulf rigs being closed down for inspection and/or repairs. By the end of the Bush administration, after those rigs came back on line, gas prices had returned to tolerable levels.

What the blogger didn't say however is that President Bush had a hostile media who buried the real reasons for negative indicators and left the public with the impression that it was the President's fault. They would put some Democrat's criticism of the President near the top of the story for instance, and tack on a headline that "The Bush Administration Comes Under Increasing Criticism" or some such as that.

The media can and does absolutely influence public perception in all who don't read much below the headlines or who do get most of their news from leftwing blogs or 30 second soundbites. And as more and more of America is dumbed down in an inferior education system, the more power the media has.

They don't do that to Obama. The mostly Obama friendly media points to every possible indicator OTHER than President Obama's policies for the reason for high gas prices. At least in the first paragraphs in the newspaper or in the lead in on the evening television news. Headlines are more likely to reflect a President who is concerned rather than policies that are at least partially to blame.

The blogger also said that even though the perception is that it isn't Obama's fault now, it couldl be a problem for him if gas prices remain high at the time of the 2012 election.

Got to love all the silly liberals, they still claim that high gas prices were Bush's fault, yet today's high gas prices are not Obama's fault.

It doesn't matter whose fault it is, if they are high in November and the economy starts to fall again because of the high fuel costs, Obama will take a big hit with the voters.

</quote>

No actually we didn't. As one of the "silly libs" you are talking about, I always blamed the oil companies and speculators for the price of gas. If you look at polls from that time, most people DID NOT blame Bush.

Granted, more people blamed Bush than they blame Obama now, (but not by a large margin 25% to 18%) but that might have something to do with the fact that Bush was an oil man that started an unnecessary war in oil country...and was photographed kissing Saudi Oil princes.

Rather have something other than an opinion piece. Real facts that can be verified if ya got 'em, because otherwise, I'd have to take this person's word (who doesn't really appear to be in the oil business).

I came up with this one, ABS:
Update: ExxonMobil is now reporting that for its retail gasoline operations in the U.S., it made an average profit of 7 cents per gallon during the first quarter of 2011.
<a href="http://www.env-econ.net/2011/05/carpe-diem-gasoline-taxes-per-gallon-are-almost-7-times-exxonmobils-profit-42-cents-vs-7-cents-for-qi.html">Environmental Economics: Gas taxes and profit per gallon are noncomparable</a>

My father was in the oil business for 30 years, ABS. I used to hammer on him about the profits and he showed me that they made around 10 cents a gallon profit. That was 30 years ago.

Like I said earlier, they have had congressional hearings on this and always walked away with nothing on the oil companies

</quote>

Quick question...................if the oil companies are only making 9 cents per gal, then why the fuck does Wall St. get 50 to 56 cents per gal?

</quote>

First..Stop the "wall street" buzz word nonsense.
To answer you question. Traders are "getting" 50 cents per gallon. I have no idea what that means anyway. Probably some interpretation by biased members of the media.
The story goes that commodities trading accounts for roughly 50 cents per gallon of gasoline. I would imagine this means at the retail level. Where this alleged data originated is a mystery.
Actually retailers make more like 2-3 cents per gallon on regular. Of course the margins for mid grade and premium are higher. Retailers sell much less of these two products.
Now, the reason margins are so low for regular....Most gas is sold at convenience stores. One store owner who I got to know very well showed me his invoices during a conversation we were having about gas prices. His retail price was just 2 cents above his cost. Why? In his words he said the only reason he sold gas was to get people to come into the store to purchase items. His markups for merchandise were 50 to 100%.
If one really wants to find a culprit for high gas prices they can look right to government.
For example. Here in NC we pay a whopping 39.5 cents per gallon fuel tax, then sales tax then the 18 cents per gallon federal tax.
Roughly 70 cents per gallon goes to government in the form of tax.
I am not implying gasoline should not be taxed. However, when the gas tax is supposed to go to roads new and existing, it gets mighty frustrating when the politicians tell us there is a shortage of money for road projects BTW 39.5 cents per gallon is one the highest gas taxes in the US.

They don't have to do that, but it's about the money.

But.....the price of gas in Saudi Arabia is less than a dollar and in Iran it's just a little more expensive than S.A. But their oil company is run by the government.

If we drilled and produced we wouldn't have to tie it to the "global commodity", but we would because our oil companies are privately owned

If oil traders and various other financial institutions are bullish on the price of gas they will buy up gas futures contracts; the demand for the contracts pushes up their prices.

Yes, their demand for contracts pushes up the value of the contracts.
So how does that push up the price of gas?
The financial institution doesn't take delivery of the gas.
They don't consume the gas.
So how do they raise the price?

There are lots of ways different events can cause commodity prices to swing one way or another. Speculators just react to those events.

Not so; although in a commodity futures contract the purchaser promises to take possession at some fixed future date, the purchaser may instead sell that contract and never take actual possession.

PAY ATTENTION (and you might learn something):

This is why you pay what you pay for gasoline:

U.S. exported more gasoline than imported last year

For the first time since 1949, the United States exported more gasoline, heating oil and diesel fuel last year than it imported, the Energy Department reported today.

Bloomberg writes that to offset weak U.S. demand, refiners exported 439,000 barrels a day more than were imported the year before. In 2010, daily imports averaged 269,000 barrels, according to the Petroleum Supply Monthly report.

Imports of crude oil and related products fell 11% last year, reaching a level not seen since 1995.

News of record gasoline exports comes as the pump price rose today for the 22nd straight day ($3.78 a gallon average) and the Energy Department reported separately that gasoline inventories fell last week while crude oil inventories and imports rose.

You are paying what you pay for gasoline because you are competing for it with the rest of the world.

U.S. refiners simply sell to whoever will pay them the best price, all things considered. If you won't pay 4 bucks a gallon for it, they'll sell it to someone who will.

btw, keep that in mind when you're foolishly thinking that the Keystone pipeline bringing oil to US refiners is going to magically lower gasoline prices...

...they'll sell THAT to the highest bidder too.

That's a red herring. We don't import gasoline, but of course we do export it so it goes without saying that we'd export more than we import (zero). It's a comparison that goes without saying, and is made for the confusion it sows.

Furthermore it's a world market, and we sell to it. The only way that could be precluded would be to nationalize the oil companies.

There is oil in S. Texas (the Gulf) that cannot be piped east because of a pipeline bottleneck, and the price is lower than the world market because of the glut there. It makes perfect sense that they would refine it and sell it at a premium, and part of that refined product would be exported, since they can't sell it profitably (glut) in their own region.

It's not driving up the price of gasoline elsewhere, and it is applies favorably to lower the US trade deficit.

Not quite. Anyone who can pass some silly litmus literacy test for the commodity exchange (in any case, anyone), can also buy and sell the actual future of a product, with a promise to accept shipment or deliver. They can also sell that contract on the open market. As it stands today, only 1/3 of the actual futures contracts on oil, are between people who can actually deliver or accept a commodity. The other 2/3rds are just gambling.

The GOP needs to emphasize this point in order to sway voters.

But when we look at the facts, there are simply too many speculators profiting from soaring gas prices. In short, the massive oil corporations and Hedge Fund managers are the real culprits. Here is a document leaked from 2008:

<a href="http://www.slideshare.net/lee_fang/energy-holdingswticrudeoil">Energy holdings-wti-crude-oil</a>

There is a deliberate effort to inflate the already outrageous prices of refined crude. Rick Ungar of Forbes magazine (not a flaming liberal rag, mind you) explains that refineries have been systematically shutting down in order to reduce national supply and jack up prices. Moreover, we see oil producers looking to sell domestic oil in foreign markets in order to boost demand. Not that there is anything illegal about that, but it certainly isn't helping out the American consumers by artificially increasing demand and reducing supply when we need the stuff to get to work and to get the economy back on track.

<a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/rickungar/2012/03/17/the-truth-about-obama-oil-and-the-gasoline-blame-game-part-two/">The Truth About Obama, Oil And The Gasoline Blame Game-Part Two - Forbes</a>

Congressman Peter Welch (D-VT) tells how apprx 50 cents on each gallon of gasoline purchased goes to speculators rather than to refinement and production costs. That's about $15 going to Banking industry like Goldman Sachs every time you fill your tank!

<a href="http://welch.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1930:after-rumors-send-oil-prices-falling-welch-renews-call-on-president-to-tap-nations-oil-reserves&amp;catid=41:2012-press-releases&amp;Itemid=32">After rumors send oil prices falling, Welch renews call on President to tap nation's oil reserves</a>

Nevertheless, the GOP is still calling for less govt regulation in banking and oil industries. In spite of the evidence to the contrary, some of us continue to blame Obama for the lack of and real conviction to control rising prices.

If anything, this sets the stage for MORE govt regulation, not less. Unless, of course, everyone is happy with gas prices where they are currently.

Yep, this is free market Capitalism at its best. And you can sure as hell expect more of this if the GOP (aka "Frontmen for the Oil Industry") ever take back the White House.

The commodity futures contract still represents physical oil. That oil is still delivered from the supplier to the consumer. If investment banks took delivery &amp; resold/rolled over that oil it would increase the amount of supply driving down the price. The physical oil has to be stored somewhere (preferably hidden from inventory) in order to drive up prices. Last time they keep the oil on a bunch of tankers out in the ocean where it did not show up in inventory.

WHERE ARE THE OIL THE SPECULATORS HOLDING ALL THAT OIL???? Inquiring minds would like to know.

<post author="Dragon" datetime="2012-03-19T08:50:00" id="p188">
Without letting the manipulators off the hook, they are able to do what they are doing only because the supply/demand ratio of oil has gotten worse. Otherwise, there would be no room for it.

This is not unlike the OPEC oil embargo of the 1970s, whose immediate cause was political manipulation by an oil cartel many of whose members were pissed off by the Yom Kippur War. But OPEC would not have been able to pull that off except that the U.S. hit its national oil peak in 1970 and, after that, became dependent on oil imports.

I'm not saying that speculation and profiteering aren't factors making the situation worse, but the geological and global-economic reality is that the era of cheap oil is over, and it's never coming back.

A month ago, I reminded everyone that ExxonMobil's CEO, Rex Tillerson, told Senator Maria Cantwell (D-WA) at a Senate Commerce Committee hearing that the oil would be about $60-70/barrel if the speculators in oil futures were not driving up the price.

Secretary Reich reminds us that, historically, 30 percent of oil futures' trades were conducted by speculators -- today, that number is 64 percent, and it is a relatively small group of traders.

Exxon-Mobil's CEO, Rex Tillerson only knows what his cost of supply is. Exxon-Mobil only makes up a small slice of the oil market. Why is he not supplying all the oil the market needs to make enormous profits at $126 Brent Crude World Price? - Someone is limiting his supply capacity.

Speculators can't drive up oil prices unless they have the means to store the oil outside of the commodities market. Inventories are below expectations &amp; the Baltic Dirty Tanker Index is low which means speculators are not renting oil tankers to store oil off-shore. There is a supply problem brought on by government!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

</quote>

Not so; although in a commodity futures contract the purchaser promises to take possession at some fixed future date, the purchaser may instead sell that contract and never take actual possession. Speculators purchasing options do not promise to take physical possession of the commodity, in this case oil. They may choose to or they may simply sell the option and reap the profit or the loss making that decision at the options exercise date, and the demand they create in the market can and does drive up prices.

</quote>

The commodity futures contract still represents physical oil. That oil is still delivered from the supplier to the consumer. If investment banks took delivery &amp; resold/rolled over that oil it would increase the amount of supply driving down the price. The physical oil has to be stored somewhere (preferably hidden from inventory) in order to drive up prices. Last time they keep the oil on a bunch of tankers out in the ocean where it did not show up in inventory.

WHERE ARE THE OIL THE SPECULATORS HOLDING ALL THAT OIL???? Inquiring minds would like to know.

</quote>

Interesting observation. During the so called "Arab oil embargo" vs the US, the news media shot film of tankers parked off the NJ/NY coast waiting to be unloaded. Until then, we Americans were told there was a severe shortage. The scam was that while we were told ot conserve gasoline, that brought into play the term "allocation". So as we did our civic duty and slashed our consumption of fuel, the so called allocation was reduced in proportion to fuel used. WTF?!!!! Use less, receive less. Nice going. As a result, we were introduced ot the term 'stagflation'....The eocnomy was at a standstill while consumer prices continued to rise.
As I recall, soon after the parked tanker scam was uncovered, the 'embargo' was lifted. Gas prices tumbled.

WHAT?!!!!!
Taxing supply only causes prices to increase as those taxes are passed along to the end user.
BTW Commodities trades ARE taxed..... <a href="http://commodities.about.com/od/taxissues/a/commodity_taxes.htm">Taxes on Commodities Trading</a>.
Tillereson told Cantwell exactly what she needed to hear. The end game is 'blame someone else'.
Newsflash...If there were no market to trade commodities, the prices for them would have to fixed by a group or entity placed in charge of this.
Are you sure you desire to see price fixing beome the procedure?

To stop Wall Street from playing hardball with your hard-earned money, we should enact a 70 percent tax on profits from oil speculator transactions. Note, this is not a tax on oil itself or even on oil companies. It is a tax on speculative profits made on Wall Street trading desks.

Let's see.

Conservatives supported the Contras, which engaged in large numbers of human rights violations, including outright murder through what became known as death squads.

Then there was the conservative support to the racist Apartheid regime of South Africa.

And who can forget the Heritage Foundation's and Grover Norquist's support for Joseph Savimbi and UNITA in Angola?

Citing one poster on USMB as the end all in conservative/libertarian views has got to be the biggest reach I've seen in a while.

Libertarians are about as close to classical liberalism as it gets today. the left wing "progressive" liberals are nothing short of full blown communist totalitarians. Like Obama.

And there are no true conservatives left on the right except the social conservative kind. Which is not what conservatism is about.

Are you fucking kidding me?

You don't see libertarians advocating for more laws, regulations and bigger government do you? NO you don't dummy.

Meanwhile progressives do nothing BUT advocate more laws, more legislation and bigger government..

Who are the authoritarians again????

Once again progressives are delusional....

Are you normally this incredibly stupid, or is this just a moment you're having?

Citing one poster on USMB as the end all in conservative/libertarian views has got to be the biggest reach I've seen in a while.

Libertarians are about as close to classical liberalism as it gets today. the left wing "progressive" liberals are nothing short of full blown communist totalitarians. Like Obama.

And there are no true conservatives left on the right except the social conservative kind. Which is not what conservatism is about.

No, they argue that there SHOULDN'T BE LAWS PROHIBITING THE USE OF DRUGS.. As in there are already laws on the books that have been legislated by tyrants....

Drugs were legal until Woodrow Wilson (a fucking tyrant) thought HE WAS A DICTATOR and started outlawing shit...

You see how that works dummy???

As it is the government is regulating what substances people can and cannot use and that goes against libertarian beliefs -- you know -- because libertarians are REAL LIBERALS unlike authoritarian progressives who believe the government SHOULD CONTROL WHAT SUBSTANCES AN INDIVIDUAL CAN INGEST....

So once again its the authoritarian tyrants (neocons, RINO's and progressives) who are the tyrants....

There shouldn't be a law in the first place.

It was the authoritarian tyrannical government that manifested the law in the first place..

Libertarians aren't advocating for the legalization of drugs, they're advocating for the repeal of present laws that outlaw drugs.

Reason: The government has no right telling individuals what they can do to their own body...

while Ron Paul forums and other moronic sites speak in gobblygook about state rights on taxes...

there exists Nationally, a bill that would allow states to legalize and regulate marijuana sales is sponsored by two men who can be considered bookends of the U.S. House of Representatives ? conservative/libertarian Republican Rep. Ron Paul, and liberal Democratic Rep. Barney Frank.

regulate sales is code for taxing - consumer taxes

message to American supporters of Israel: In 1977, Helms was the sole senator to vote against prohibiting American companies from joining the Arab League boycott of Israel,[40] although this was primarily because the bill also relaxed discrimination against communist countries.[41] In 1982, Helms even called for the U.S. to break diplomatic relations with Israel during the 1982 Lebanon War.[42] <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesse_Helms#Foreign_affairs">Jesse Helms - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</a>

Do American Conservatives and Libertarians adore dictatorships, totalitarianism?

</quote>

Let?s say their dogma is predicated on authoritarianism ? conservatives have an intense need to compel others to conform, they detest diversity and dissent, and as reactionaries long for an idealized American past that never really existed in the first place.

They don?t intentionally ?adore? dictatorships, but share many similar traits, however inadvertent.

To wit:

Polarization also has affected the two parties differently. The Republican Party has drifted much farther to the right than the Democratic Party has drifted to the left. Jacob Hacker, a professor at Yale, whose 2006 book, ?Off Center,? documented this trend, told me, citing Poole and Rosenthal?s data on congressional voting records, that, since 1975, ?Senate Republicans moved roughly twice as far to the right as Senate Democrats moved to the left? and ?House Republicans moved roughly six times as far to the right as House Democrats moved to the left.? In other words, the story of the past few decades is asymmetric polarization.

Two well-known Washington political analysts, Thomas Mann, of the bipartisan Brookings Institution, and Norman Ornstein, of the conservative American Enterprise Institute, agree.

In a forthcoming book about Washington dysfunction, ?It?s Even Worse Than It Looks,? they write, ?One of our two major parties, the Republicans, has become an insurgent outlier?ideologically extreme, contemptuous of the inherited social and economic policy regime, scornful of compromise, unpersuaded by conventional understanding of facts, evidence and science, and dismissive of the legitimacy of its political opposition.?

The deal is, you don't make the ideal the enemy of the good. If you have to choose between the very bad and the horrible, you go for the lesser evil.

That does not mean the lesser evil is the goal and you support it contrary to all sense. Though one can argue we have done that mistake.

One of the failures of US Foreign policy has been to assume that we are stuck with Hobson's choice. That is not always the case. We may just need to recognize there are more options.

Liberals like to treat each case as if it had no relation to what is going on around it. You either support or oppose this moderately bad with no recognition of what the alternatives are or what the surrounding circumstances are.

There is more to Foreign affairs than just one question in one place. A lot of times when you flip one counter, lots of other counters around it also flip in ways that can cause greater problems than leaving well enough alone

You offer that quote as though them saying such tripe somehow makes it "right."

The fact of the matter is, they are full of shit.

The Republican Party isn't the engine of change. The Republican Party is part of the problem.

The engine of change lies in the awakening many of us are having over how badly off-course we are.

I keep reading the propaganda of the day which seeks to "define" who and what conservatives are. But it's malarkey.

Conservatives don't seek the status quo. Why would we wish to keep things the "way they are" when the way things are are so fucked up, due to incremental liberal changes, that we have ended up in a very bad place?

Conservatives, properly understood, seek to put things BACK to the way they are SUPPOSED TO BE.

Pontificators can label that effort "ideologically extreme, contemptuous of the inherited social and economic policy regime, scornful of compromise, unpersuaded by conventional understanding of facts, evidence and science, and dismissive of the legitimacy of its political opposition." In fact, that's got some truth in it.

If looking to correct our course is considered ideologically extreme, then count me in. If it constitutes being "contemptuous of the inherited social and economic policy regime," then yeah, that's me. I AM contemptuous of the notion that because this is where we've landed, we are obligated to STAY HERE. That's ridiculous. HERE is not a good place. We are in danger of crumbling. We DO in fact need to move. I AM contemptuous of the silly modern American liberalism that takes us here and seeks to move us even further away from where we should be. I DO scorn "compromise" which serves only to solidify the invalid "gains" of the left over these many recent years. You bet your ASS that I am "unpersuaded by conventional understanding of facts, evidence and science [sic]," when those "fats" aren't real facts, the evidence has gotten deliberately distorted and the science is fiction. And no. The political opposition is not "legitimate" exactly to the extent that they rebuff the strictures of the Constitutionally imposed limits on government authority and power.

Words like progressive, liberal, conservative, libertarian authoritarian, and totalitarian are too difficult for many to rationalize.

and whom did Reagan trade arms to in violation of American law?

November 13, 1986 -- in his first public statement about the allegations of secret arms-for-hostages negotiations with Iran

"In spite of the wildly speculative and false stories of arms for hostages and alleged ransom payments, we did not -- repeat did not -- trade weapons or anything else for hostages nor will we."

March 3, 1987 -- from a televised address in which he admitted to the findings of the Tower Commission

"A few months ago, I told the American people I did not trade arms for hostages. My heart and my best intentions still tell me that's true, but the facts and evidence tell me it is not."

Sarah Palin: "McCains Campaign Managers Wouldn't Let Us Investigate Obama's Past."
</headline>
<post author="Mudslinger" datetime="2012-03-12T16:00:00" id="p1">
The guy she is refering to is Steve Schmidt who I think was a terrible campaign manager who became a turncoat. He sabotaged McCain/Palin by making the decision to not go after Obama's past as well as deciding that McCain should suspend his campaign and go to Washington on the bailout crisis, a move that Palin opposed and warned him it would kill their chances. She was right. I personally believe Palin needs to force a brokered convention and run and expose Obama. Romney will not do it. I knew she was being shackeled during the election by McCain's managers. That was a terrible mistake but I have a feeling McCain cut a deal with Obama through their campaign managers that Palin wasn't aware of pertaining to the fact that both McCain and Obama weren't Constitutionally eligible and they agreed to not bring it up between the two camps. In this short interview she explains what happened. On a side note, she looks absolutely stunning in this interview.

What do you expect from a man that is all too readily willing to reach across the aisle to the left to set up Conservatives for a good drubbing from them?

And he repeats the same shit...and is called a "Maverick" by the leftist media. (There a clue here)...and then goes back to Arizona for re-election parading around saying he's 'Conservative'...gets re-elected, and goes back to old habits.

I admire his military service and what he endured...him as a politician...is where it ends. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/eusa_hand.gif"/>

And you would be correct my friend. I actually worked on the campaign. We started receiving texts or emails not to say anything negative regarding to his possible religion or even mention his middle name or church. We were not allowed to do any of that in the districts I was in. I think the media was reporting 80% negative stories on McCain compared to about 25% negative stories on Obama. It was lopsided in the positive media coverage when it came to favor-ability for Obama. Anything deemed negative a campaign staffer allegedly would say, the media would label the whole campaign racist. Even McCain was so sensitive he even apologized for radio host Billy Cunnigham for mentioning Obama's middle name at a McCain rally prior to McCain taking the stage. You're right, McCain didn't want Palin to upstage him and her campaign stops received 30% more people than he.

The lesson to be learned here is that wallowing in self pity is not a good thing. We lost the election. Move on. Everytime the left brings up Bush or Palin were all over them. What's good for the goose.......

Besides we have enough rdean radical types already.

<post author="Mudslinger" datetime="2012-03-12T17:02:00" id="p27">
All of this information about Obama's radical connections have been known since 2008. These facts have been hiding in plain sight all along.The media has failed to report it, and the media has failed or more accurately refused to demand proof of Obama's identity and eligibility. It still refuses to do so. Sheriff Joe Arpaio's investigation has proven his birth certificate to be a forgery along with his selective service card. That's just the preliminary findings. The media should be abolished for their failure to report this. As the Sheriff said this morning in a interview, "This is 10 times bigger than Watergate".

All of this information about Obama's radical connections have been known since 2008.

It still refuses to do so. Sheriff Joe Arpaio's investigation has proven his birth certificate to be a forgery along with his selective service card. That's just the preliminary findings.

they dealt with that issue in the flim.

what they wouldn't permit her to do was run a racist campaign in McCain's name. that is what she wanted and he wouldn't base his campaign on attacking a black pastor.

but that's because McCain's actually a decent guy.

and it's not like the tweeting twit who said there are "pro america parts of the country" would have looked any smarter if she brought McCain into the slime and mud.

Aside from the jurisdictional question, and his interest in birth certificates, Arpaio has a few legal problems of his own.

The guy she is refering to is Steve Schmidt who I think was a terrible campaign manager who became a turncoat. He sabotaged McCain/Palin by making the decision to not go after Obama's past as well as deciding that McCain should suspend his campaign and go to Washington on the bailout crisis, a move that Palin opposed and warned him it would kill their chances. She was right. I personally believe Palin needs to force a brokered convention and run and expose Obama. Romney will not do it. I knew she was being shackeled during the election by McCain's managers. That was a terrible mistake but I have a feeling McCain cut a deal with Obama through their campaign managers that Palin wasn't aware of pertaining to the fact that both McCain and Obama weren't Constitutionally eligible and they agreed to not bring it up between the two camps. In this short interview she explains what happened. On a side note, she looks absolutely stunning in this interview.

BTW Schmidt made it mandatory that no one NO ONE was to talk about Obama in a negative way.

We had this dude in our sights. McCain let him. I hate John with a passion now. He let them rip Sarah.

I really really hate him.

We could have taken out Obama lickety split with all the shit we had on him. No. Not with McCain holier than thou piece of crap. Meghan hated Sarah and really worked on leaking everything she could.

The guy she is refering to is Steve Schmidt who I think was a terrible campaign manager who became a turncoat. He sabotaged McCain/Palin by making the decision to not go after Obama's past as well as deciding that McCain should suspend his campaign and go to Washington on the bailout crisis, a move that Palin opposed and warned him it would kill their chances. She was right. I personally believe Palin needs to force a brokered convention and run and expose Obama. Romney will not do it. I knew she was being shackeled during the election by McCain's managers. That was a terrible mistake but I have a feeling McCain cut a deal with Obama through their campaign managers that Palin wasn't aware of pertaining to the fact that both McCain and Obama weren't Constitutionally eligible and they agreed to not bring it up between the two camps. In this short interview she explains what happened. On a side note, she looks absolutely stunning in this interview.

BTW Schmidt made it mandatory that no one NO ONE was to talk about Obama in a negative way.

We had this dude in our sights. McCain let him. I hate John with a passion now. He let them rip Sarah.

I really really hate him.

We could have taken out Obama lickety split with all the shit we had on him. No. Not with McCain holier than thou piece of crap. Meghan hated Sarah and really worked on leaking everything she could.

What a bitch.

You are correct about Megan. She hated Bristol Palin with a passion as well as Sarah. As soon as the election was over she went on Megyn Kelly to trash Palin.

I think Dole's campaign was sabotaged in the same way.

During the 96' campaign Bob Dole was advised not to be funny, be serious. Bob Dole was a funny motherfucker, but his campaign advised him to stay serious.

After Dole lost the election he a Clinton went around the country and even showed up in Somalia. Dole busted everyone up. Clinton was 2 hours late. By the time he arrived everyone was pissed.

they dealt with that issue in the flim.

what they wouldn't permit her to do was run a racist campaign in McCain's name. that is what she wanted and he wouldn't base his campaign on attacking a black pastor.

but that's because McCain's actually a decent guy.

and it's not like the tweeting twit who said there are "pro america parts of the country" would have looked any smarter if she brought McCain into the slime and mud.

The guy she is refering to is Steve Schmidt who I think was a terrible campaign manager who became a turncoat.

No one could investigate Obama's past without being called a RACIST--and I am certain that was what it was all about.

Still today--NO ONE can criticize Obama's policies without being called a racist. You gripe about gas prices--you're a racist--you bring up Obama's economy--you're a racist--you bring up run away government spending--you're a racist, etc. etc. etc.

Here's the reason as stated by the VP of the Confederacy:

"But not to be tedious in enumerating the numerous changes for the better, allow me to allude to one other-though last, not least: the new Constitution has put at rest forever all the agitating questions relating to our peculiar institutions-African slavery as it exists among us-the proper status of the negro in our form of civilization. This was the immediate cause of the late rupture and present revolution. "

No, it makes him a British Subject and not eligible for the presidency or Article 2 Section 1. Read the last sentence from a paragraph from his campaign website Fight the Smears.

"When Barack Obama Jr. was born on Aug. 4,1961, in Honolulu, Kenya was a British colony, still part of the United Kingdom’s dwindling empire. As a Kenyan native, Barack Obama Sr. was a British subject whose citizenship status was governed by The British Nationality Act of 1948. That same act governed the status of Obama Sr.‘s children.

Todd Palin is Native American in the right-winger's eyes, because he's 1/8th Yup'ik, yet President Obama's 1/2 African blood doesn't make him black.

Sorry bout that,

1. McCain didn't have what it takes to be President, still doesn't.
2. I'm glad as hell he isn't acting like he wants to be President again.
3. He should of kept on the campaign trail, but that idjit, runs back to DC acting like he's some great fucking senator, or some shit.
4. I myself don't think he was ever great at anything.
5. What a tool of the media, and the libtards, that about sums up *his world*.

The guy she is refering to is Steve Schmidt who I think was a terrible campaign manager who became a turncoat. He sabotaged McCain/Palin by making the decision to not go after Obama's past as well as deciding that McCain should suspend his campaign and go to Washington on the bailout crisis, a move that Palin opposed and warned him it would kill their chances. She was right. I personally believe Palin needs to force a brokered convention and run and expose Obama. Romney will not do it. I knew she was being shackeled during the election by McCain's managers. That was a terrible mistake but I have a feeling McCain cut a deal with Obama through their campaign managers that Palin wasn't aware of pertaining to the fact that both McCain and Obama weren't Constitutionally eligible and they agreed to not bring it up between the two camps. In this short interview she explains what happened. On a side note, she looks absolutely stunning in this interview.

Try digging farther down than the headlines, toots.
""""Obama gets involved
Barack Obama clearly saw the potential of the New Party, because he was soon seeking their support -alongside Michael Chandler, Willie Delgado, Miguel del Valle, Alice Palmer, Sonya Sanchez and Jesse Garcia.[3]"""""

The newspaper article exaggerates. No one seeking a state senate seat is going to join a wild card third-rail political party. They are either going to be a Dem or a Republican. No exceptions. But you're so freaking naive I think you'd believe something scribbled on a napkin as long as it was critical of Obama.

Many conservatives accuse Hitler of being a leftist, on the grounds that his party was named "National Socialist." But socialism requires worker ownership and control of the means of production. In Nazi Germany, private capitalist individuals owned the means of production, and they in turn were frequently controlled by the Nazi party and state. True socialism does not advocate such economic dictatorship -- it can only be democratic. Hitler's other political beliefs place him almost always on the far right. He advocated racism over racial tolerance, eugenics over freedom of reproduction, merit over equality, competition over cooperation, power politics and militarism over pacifism, dictatorship over democracy, capitalism over Marxism, realism over idealism, nationalism over internationalism, exclusiveness over inclusiveness, common sense over theory or science, pragmatism over principle, and even held friendly relations with the Church, even though he was an atheist.

The President is not a Socialist. Calling for higher progressive taxes on the rich (ie a max out at 35% was it?) may be a cheap populous ploy to get reelected that won't solve any real problems, but it certainly doesn’t make Obama a socialist. Calling for a 30%ish tax rate on capital gains does not make you a socialist. Calling for Government run Healthcare that still has many aspects run by private insurers does not make you a socialist.

Until Obama starts forcing every employer in the united states to start redistributing its profits equally amongst the employees who produce, or until he calls for maybe an 80-90% tax rate on the richest Americans so that it can be redistributed by the government, I’m not buying the socialist label. That’s total nonsense.

Hey. Don't take OUR word for it:

Hitler, Socialist, Supreme Community Organizer and Hater of Capitialists...... just like Barry:

"In the World War we had them as external foes, in our struggle as internal foes, and now, as a National-Socialist State, as external foes again.

And again it is no accident that the same State which at that time thought it could bring about the collapse of Germany by a flood of lying propaganda, now again sends a man on the same mission. Then his name was Wilson; now his name is Roosevelt. The Germany of that time, without any education in state and national politics, without any unity, without any enlightenment on the problem of the Jewish question and the working of that power, fell victim to that attack.

The great mistake is that our enemies now imagine it will happen a second time. For if at that time we were perhaps the best organized people in the world, without doubt again we are now the best organized people in the world. And if anyone in the rest of the world imagines he can shatter this people, he does not know the enduring heart of this people today, nor the enduring power, the knowledge which guides this people politically today-the National Socialist Party and its mighty organization.

Neither has he any idea of what this movement has achieved since then, how it has taken hold of our people by its accomplishments, and how it has fulfilled the Socialist ideal-which is free of all international cheating, all the "lying tirades," how it has fulfilled these Socialist ideals in a way that no other State has even begun to approach up to now, to say nothing of attain.

I am calm therefore when I face any German who is fighting in the East, or who comes home on leave-and I can tell each one of them, just look at our organization. Compare our home cities, compare the workers' settlements which we are building, compare our social organization with what you have seen on the other side. Compare the fate and the lot of the German farmer with the lot of that Russian farmer. Compare all of that, my dear friend, and then give me your judgment as to who has managed things better, and above all else, who has had more honorable intentions?

Not one man has as yet returned, who could express any other opinion than that if a Socialistic State were in the process of being realized anywhere, it was in Germany only that it was actually taking place. That is still another reason why this other world which so willingly represents capitalistic interests in particular, is attacking us. It is a combine, which even today still pretends to be able to rule the world according to its private capitalistic interests, to manage it, and when necessary, to keep on ruling it. "

Obama is a Marxist. No, he can't install Marxist doctrine quickly or easily because of that pesky old Constitution (the one he would dearly love to entirely ignore) and the fact that we have two sides of both Houses of Congress. He has been able to cram Obamacare down our throats in an attempt to gain government control of a large portion of our economy, he is slyly claiming to increase oil production (for purposes of getting votes) while he is actually inhibiting production (to drive fuel prices higher), he is slyly claiming to NOT want to control the public's handguns while backing such idiocy as Fast and Furious to gain support for gun control (too bad he got caught) and Hillary favors our signing a treaty with other countries to establish some sort of global gun control (that will infringe upon our constitutional rights), He has appointed umpteen unelected "Czars" to run various facets of government (go through the list of them-you will find socialists and Marxists and others with views diametrically opposed to American freedoms).

Obama is a Marxist! He chooses his friends carefully...among them "my Marxist professors", Jeremiah Wright, Bill Ayres...the list of anti-Americans goes on.

Liberals kiss his ass because he is a slick talking black guy will extreme liberal ideals and that is ALL IT TAKES for them to rally. Pseudo-intellectual twits!

You do understand that that racist pig Hitler was a Socialist exclusively for the supposed superior German race right. Death and slavery to all others whom he considered inferior. Calling his dream of a master race of ayrians a socialistic state does not really make him a Socialist. This was just a rah-rah speech to his faithful. He was a master propagandist and you must look at the actions of his regime rather than his speeches and or rhetoric.

The happiest place on earth is socialist....

For the past decade, social scientists and pollsters have given elaborate questionnaires to hundreds of thousands of people around the globe. Two of the largest studies that rank the happiness of countries around the world are the World Map of Happiness from the University of Leiscester and the World Database of Happiness from Ruut Veenhoven of Erasmus University Rotterdam. All the happiness surveys ask people basically the same question: How happy are you?

"The answer you get is not only how they feel right now, but also how they feel about their entire life," explained Dan Buettner, who has studied happiness and longevity around the world through his Blue Zones project Buettner said that if you mine all the databases of universities and research centers, you'll find that the happiest place on earth is ? Denmark. Cold, dreary, unspectacular Denmark.

Could the Danes really be the happiest people in the world? When ABC News anchor Bill Weir traveled there to find out, he asked random Danes to rate themselves in terms of happiness, on a scale of one to 10. Many people rated themselves at least an eight, and there were several nines and 10s. Finally, one grouchy Dane came along who said she didn't believe Danes were so happy. But then she quickly conceded that she herself felt rather content with her life, and said Danes in general had very little to complain about.
Danes do have one potential complaint: high taxes. The happiest people in the world pay some of the highest taxes in the world -- between 50 percent and 70 percent of their incomes. In exchange, the government covers all health care and education, and spends more on children and the elderly than any country in the world per capita. With just 5.5 million people, the system is efficient, and people feel "tryghed" -- the Danish word for "tucked in" -- like a snug child.
Those high taxes have another effect. Since a banker can end up taking home as much money as an artist, people don't chose careers based on income or status. "They have this thing called 'Jante-lov,' which essentially says, 'You're no better then anybody else,'" said Buettner. "A garbage man can live in a middle-class neighborhood and hold his head high."

Obama is a Marxist! He chooses his friends carefully...among them "my Marxist professors", Jeremiah Wright, Bill Ayres...the list of anti-Americans goes on.

President Obama is not a marxist, socialist or communist.

Socialism refers to a broad set of economic theories of social organization advocating state or collective ownership and administration of the means of production and distribution of goods, and the creation of an egalitarian society.

He is in fact a moderate capitalist.

All your talking point fall flat.

The new healthcare reform is not an example of state control.

Oil productrion records do not lie.

If shooting a President and his aid at point blank range in broad daylight didn't garner enough support to ban hand guns in this nation who would be stupid enough to believe a suggestion that a policy aimed at Mexicans would ever gain support among Americans to ban guns? <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/cuckoo.gif"/>

The President is not a Socialist. Calling for higher progressive taxes on the rich (ie a max out at 35% was it?) may be a cheap populous ploy to get reelected that won't solve any real problems, but it certainly doesn’t make Obama a socialist. Calling for a 30%ish tax rate on capital gains does not make you a socialist. Calling for Government run Healthcare that still has many aspects run by private insurers does not make you a socialist.

Until Obama starts forcing every employer in the united states to start redistributing its profits equally amongst the employees who produce, or until he calls for maybe an 80-90% tax rate on the richest Americans so that it can be redistributed by the government, I’m not buying the socialist label. That’s total nonsense.

The happiest place on earth is socialist....

For the past decade, social scientists and pollsters have given elaborate questionnaires to hundreds of thousands of people around the globe. Two of the largest studies that rank the happiness of countries around the world are the World Map of Happiness from the University of Leiscester and the World Database of Happiness from Ruut Veenhoven of Erasmus University Rotterdam. All the happiness surveys ask people basically the same question: How happy are you?

"The answer you get is not only how they feel right now, but also how they feel about their entire life," explained Dan Buettner, who has studied happiness and longevity around the world through his Blue Zones project Buettner said that if you mine all the databases of universities and research centers, you'll find that the happiest place on earth is ? Denmark. Cold, dreary, unspectacular Denmark.

Could the Danes really be the happiest people in the world? When ABC News anchor Bill Weir traveled there to find out, he asked random Danes to rate themselves in terms of happiness, on a scale of one to 10. Many people rated themselves at least an eight, and there were several nines and 10s. Finally, one grouchy Dane came along who said she didn't believe Danes were so happy. But then she quickly conceded that she herself felt rather content with her life, and said Danes in general had very little to complain about.
Danes do have one potential complaint: high taxes. The happiest people in the world pay some of the highest taxes in the world -- between 50 percent and 70 percent of their incomes. In exchange, the government covers all health care and education, and spends more on children and the elderly than any country in the world per capita. With just 5.5 million people, the system is efficient, and people feel "tryghed" -- the Danish word for "tucked in" -- like a snug child.
Those high taxes have another effect. Since a banker can end up taking home as much money as an artist, people don't chose careers based on income or status. "They have this thing called 'Jante-lov,' which essentially says, 'You're no better then anybody else,'" said Buettner. "A garbage man can live in a middle-class neighborhood and hold his head high."

I still don’t agree. You can’t say that, “theoretically someone would do this if…” and then pass that off as proof that someone is or isn’t a marxist/socialist. From the words that I’ve heard come out of Obama’s mouth, and the policies he’s supported/not supported, I’ve concluded that his actions and initiatives to date do not in any way prove that Obama is a marxist.

Supporting Universal Healthcare does not make one a Marxist. There's still a thriving intellectual debate on whether or not Healthcare is one of those few things that government can run more effectively than the private market – like police dept - for people on the left and right alike. The argument is, when consumers know nothing of price/quality of treatment, how is this going to drive efficiency in a healthcare market? Healthcare is an extremely unique area of economics. Saying that you want government run healthcare is not the same as saying that you want the government to take over all internet companies, or all grocery stores, ect.

The fact that the government sets limits on credit products and mandates compensation rules puts smaller community banks at the most disadvantage because the mega banks can afford the extra financial burden this causes while the smaller banks are priced out of the market. The government can determine whether a bank is offering an unfair product and can ration credit. Who do you think gets hurt the most? You think the big banks are really hurting from the increased regulatory burden? Not if you look at the stock market they're not.

The smaller banks that had nothing to do with the financial crisis now pay the penalty of increased compliance cost that really doesn't do anything to hurt the large banks at the end of the day.

Not necessarily.

1.) What about when you have a situation where an industry giant uses its massive power to lobby congress to pass a bill that would somehow limit the innovation capabilities of a small competing company, in order to ensure that the giant will retain it's super hold on the industry - is that a fair economy?

2.) What about when you have a situation where an industry giant lobbies congress to make sure that only it gets a tax break, or a subsidy, via some obscure loophole, in order to give the company an edge over smaller competitors - is that a fair economy?

Saying that you "want a fair economy" is not interchangeable with saying that you want "public ownership of resources and production". It can simply mean that you want to correct some of the unfair advantages the industry superpowers have because of their enhanced access to Congress.

Often, it's the Capitalists who are the biggest threat to the Free Market.

Danes do have one potential complaint: high taxes. The happiest people in the world pay some of the highest taxes in the world -- between 50 percent and 70 percent of their incomes. In exchange, the government covers all health care and education, and spends more on children and the elderly than any country in the world per capita. With just 5.5 million people, the system is efficient, and people feel "tryghed" -- the Danish word for "tucked in" -- like a snug child.
Those high taxes have another effect. Since a banker can end up taking home as much money as an artist, people don't chose careers based on income or status. "They have this thing called 'Jante-lov,' which essentially says, 'You're no better then anybody else,'" said Buettner. "A garbage man can live in a middle-class neighborhood and hold his head high."

Hey, great idea, let's send our undocumented workers there. It's for their oen good. Let's just start out with a small number, say, 6, or 12, or 18 Million. After they get Citizenship, we can double our efforts. We are only looking out for their own good.

Say what, Denmark's Infrastructure can't handle the overload? Why is that a factor? Why should that even matter?

Didn't you read the top of the paper?

"A Fair Economy."

That is code word for "public ownership of resources and production."

</quote>

Not necessarily.

1.) What about when you have a situation where an industry giant uses its massive power to lobby congress to pass a bill that would somehow limit the innovation capabilities of a small competing company, in order to ensure that the giant will retain it's super hold on the industry - is that a fair economy?

2.) What about when you have a situation where an industry giant lobbies congress to make sure that only it gets a tax break, or a subsidy, via some obscure loophole, in order to give the company an edge over smaller competitors - is that a fair economy?

Saying that you "want a fair economy" is not interchangeable with saying that you want "public ownership of resources and production". It can simply mean that you want to correct some of the unfair advantages the industry superpowers have because of their enhanced access to Congress.

Often, it's the Capitalists who are the biggest threat to the Free Market.

</quote>

1) No.... That's a Hamilton Economy.

2) Same thing.

You know, the type of card game where the Government deals the cards, peaks at what it is holding, and then makes up the rules for that hand, and tells us only what it says we need to know. You should know that by now.

It took someone like Pope John Paul, to recognize this bad behavior and apologize for it. He also tried to bring all faiths together. Pope Benedict, given his Nazi past, was a remarkably bad choice, however.

You're a free thinking libertarian. You know damn well Obama serves corporate interests first. That's the antithesis of a marxist.

Who do you think benefited the most from Dodd-Frank and Obamacare? Corporate America.

Big banks thank Obama for the competition killing regulation in Dodd-Frank, and big insurance companies thank him for the healthcare mandate.

Marxism is supposed to take from the top and give to the bottom. Obama's record so far has taken everything from the bottom and given it to the top.

Dumbass,

The Nazis created socilized medical care, they put production under the control of the Govt with select individuals (Nazi Party members) being the owners and raking in the money on the backs of Jew workers. They talked about a collective society, everyone pitching in.

They hated the communists because they were farther left and were.....SLAVS, Russians.....an inferior race to the German blonde machine.

Many conservatives accuse Hitler of being a leftist, on the grounds that his party was named "National Socialist." But socialism requires worker ownership and control of the means of production. In Nazi Germany, private capitalist individuals owned the means of production, and they in turn were frequently controlled by the Nazi party and state. True socialism does not advocate such economic dictatorship -- it can only be democratic. Hitler's other political beliefs place him almost always on the far right. He advocated racism over racial tolerance, eugenics over freedom of reproduction, merit over equality, competition over cooperation, power politics and militarism over pacifism, dictatorship over democracy, capitalism over Marxism, realism over idealism, nationalism over internationalism, exclusiveness over inclusiveness, common sense over theory or science, pragmatism over principle, and even held friendly relations with the Church, even though he was an atheist.

The Nazis merged corporations into giant Cartels, under the control of their buddies.

As Mussolini said, it was the merging of corporate and government power.

The Government didn't take over the corporations, the corporations merged with government.

And they didn't redistribute equally or "each according to their needs".

And certainly, 100%, subjugating a portion of the population, and making them an underclass (before exterminating them) is in no way in keeping with Marxist theory.

For now. They are not yet that far corrupted. At the Time, his time, Socialism was his tool. Fortunately for us, Hitler was his own worst Enemy, and undermined his own efforts in WWII. He came very close. Fortunately for us his concept of true Socialism only applied to Pure Blooded Aryans. so in effect, his bigotry, was part of his weakness.

Nazism, the common short form name of National Socialism (German: Nationalsozialismus) was the ideology and practice of the National Socialist German Workers' Party (otherwise known as the Nazi Party) and of Nazi Germany.[1][2][3][4] It is a unique variety of fascism that incorporates biological racism and antisemitism.[5] Nazism was founded out of elements of the far-right racist völkisch German nationalist movement and the violent anti-communist Freikorps paramilitary culture that fought against the uprisings of communist revolutionaries in post-World War I Germany.[6] The ideology was developed first by Anton Drexler and then Adolf Hitler as a means to draw workers away from communism and into völkisch nationalism. [7] Initially Nazi political strategy focused on anti-big business, anti-bourgeois, and anti-capitalist rhetoric, though such aspects were later downplayed in the 1930s to gain the support from industrial owners for the Nazis; focus was shifted to anti-Semitic and anti-Marxist themes.[8] Nazism promoted political violence, militarism, and war, it conceived of politics as being a "battle", and the Nazis utilized their paramilitary organization, the Sturmabteilung (SA) for violent attacks upon those they opposed, particularly communists, Jews, and social democrats. [9] Hitler and the Nazis openly promoted German territorial expansionism into Eastern Europe to be Lebensraum ("living space") for German settlers that would result in the creation of a "Greater Germanic Realm".[10]

Nazism advocated the supremacy of the claimed Aryan master race over all other races.[11] Nazis viewed the progress of humanity as depending on the Aryans and believed that it could maintain its dominance only if it retained its purity and instinct for self-preservation.[12] They claimed that Jews were the greatest threat to the Aryan race.[13] They considered Jews a parasitic race that attached itself to various ideologies and movements to secure its self-preservation, such as capitalism, the Enlightenment, industrialisation, liberalism, Marxism, democracy, and trade unionism.[13] To maintain the purity and strength of the Aryan race, the Nazis sought to exterminate Jews, Romani, and the physically and mentally disabled.[14] Other groups deemed "degenerate" and "asocial" who were not targeted for extermination, but received exclusionary treatment by the Nazi state, included: homosexuals, blacks, Jehovah's Witnesses and political opponents.[14]

Nazism promoted an economic system that supported a stratified economy with classes based on merit and talent while rejecting universal egalitarianism, retaining private property, freedom of contract, and promoted the creation of national solidarity that would transcend class distinction.[15][16] Hitler claimed that unconditional equality of opportunity for all able racially-sound Aryan German males in Germany was the essence of the socialism of German National Socialism. [17] This was known as völkisch equality that officially ascribed collective racial equality of opportunity, equality before the law, and full legal rights to able people of Aryan blood but deliberately excluded people outside of this definition who were regarded as inferior and rejected the conception of universal human equality.[18] The Nazis criminalized strikes by employees and lockouts by employers for being contrary to national unity and the state took over the approval process of setting wage and salary levels.[19]

The Nazis were presented by Hitler and other proponents and viewed by some scholars as being neither left-wing nor right-wing but politically syncretic.[20][21][22][23] However major elements of Nazism have been deemed as clearly far-right, such as its goals of the right of claimed superior people to dominate while purging society of claimed inferior elements.[24]

Many conservatives accuse Hitler of being a leftist, on the grounds that his party was named "National Socialist." But socialism requires worker ownership and control of the means of production. In Nazi Germany, private capitalist individuals owned the means of production, and they in turn were frequently controlled by the Nazi party and state. True socialism does not advocate such economic dictatorship -- it can only be democratic. Hitler's other political beliefs place him almost always on the far right. He advocated racism over racial tolerance, eugenics over freedom of reproduction, merit over equality, competition over cooperation, power politics and militarism over pacifism, dictatorship over democracy, capitalism over Marxism, realism over idealism, nationalism over internationalism, exclusiveness over inclusiveness, common sense over theory or science, pragmatism over principle, and even held friendly relations with the Church, even though he was an atheist.

<quote orig_author="Chris">
The happiest place on earth is socialist....

For the past decade, social scientists and pollsters have given elaborate questionnaires to hundreds of thousands of people around the globe. Two of the largest studies that rank the happiness of countries around the world are the World Map of Happiness from the University of Leiscester and the World Database of Happiness from Ruut Veenhoven of Erasmus University Rotterdam. All the happiness surveys ask people basically the same question: How happy are you?

"The answer you get is not only how they feel right now, but also how they feel about their entire life," explained Dan Buettner, who has studied happiness and longevity around the world through his Blue Zones project Buettner said that if you mine all the databases of universities and research centers, you'll find that the happiest place on earth is ? Denmark. Cold, dreary, unspectacular Denmark.

Could the Danes really be the happiest people in the world? When ABC News anchor Bill Weir traveled there to find out, he asked random Danes to rate themselves in terms of happiness, on a scale of one to 10. Many people rated themselves at least an eight, and there were several nines and 10s. Finally, one grouchy Dane came along who said she didn't believe Danes were so happy. But then she quickly conceded that she herself felt rather content with her life, and said Danes in general had very little to complain about.
Danes do have one potential complaint: high taxes. The happiest people in the world pay some of the highest taxes in the world -- between 50 percent and 70 percent of their incomes. In exchange, the government covers all health care and education, and spends more on children and the elderly than any country in the world per capita. With just 5.5 million people, the system is efficient, and people feel "tryghed" -- the Danish word for "tucked in" -- like a snug child.
Those high taxes have another effect. Since a banker can end up taking home as much money as an artist, people don't chose careers based on income or status. "They have this thing called 'Jante-lov,' which essentially says, 'You're no better then anybody else,'" said Buettner. "A garbage man can live in a middle-class neighborhood and hold his head high."

Unheard Of: Obama Unleashes Attack Ad Aimed At Sarah Palin, A Civilian. Why?
</headline>
<post author="Mudslinger" datetime="2012-03-11T18:47:00" id="p1">
Of all people he releases a campaign attack ad on her and not the other candidates. She is a civilian and not running for office as of now. In watching the ad it is apparent that Governor Palin is actually correct in her statements. All I can say is that Obama must be scared that she will force a brokered convention and it looks like it might happen the way the GOP pundits are talking. This attack ad clearly defines a sense of insecurity coming from the Obama campaign pertaining to her.

She is not running for office at this very moment, but she has already hinted at a brokered convention and stepping up as an alternate choice....and she is also out there for future offices.

Unless you want to tell us that Palin announced that she is no longer a politician, with no plans to ever run for office again.......has she?

Me too. He'll keep the votes from the O-bots who would support him no matter what he does. He'll not win the votes from those who are against him no matter what he does. So far, zero gain, zero loss among those groups.

But, I can't see this being effective for the undecided and independents. They pay more attention than those who practice contempt/adoration without prior investigation.

So, base on that...........

If Palin hadn't made that statement last week, the OP might have a point.

As it stands, the Breitbart hate machine (which also hosts this link) has tried to muckrake off of race baiting.

It was stupid, and Obsma is going to make money off of it (and win votes).

Limbaugh is going to get some ad time too. If you think Obama is just going to run against the GOP candidate, you have a surprise coming. He's going to run against the hateful far right.

If the GOP was smart, they'd distance themselves from the far right. They won't though. They'll double down on crazy.

This attack ad clearly defines a sense of insecurity coming from the Obama campaign pertaining to her.

<a href="http://www.breitbart.com/Breitbart-TV/2012/03/11/Pathetic%20Four%20Yerars%20Later%20Obama%20Campaign%20Still%20Running%20Against%20Palin">Four Years Later, Obama Campaign Still Running Against Palin</a>

</quote>

First, only a complete moron believes there will be a brokered convention and that Sarah Palin will come out as the GOP candidate despite not having spent a single day on the campaign trail.

So that is not the motive behind this ad.

The motive behind this ad is that most Americans find Sarah Palin to be a complete dumbass. And so any association Obama can make between Palin and the GOP will pull the Undecideds off the fence toward his side.

Ok. Now I see it. It's a campaign youtube. I thought it was supposed to be some sort of network ad or something by the "UNLEASHED" title. Man, everyone has to sensationalize these days. Anyway... Ok, yeah, the Obama campaign used Palins remarks in an ad for campaign contributions. I don't see a whole lot of reason except politics as usual. I wouldn't go after Palin if I were running the campaign. She's a pretty polarizing figure on her own, you don't really have to go after her, I don't think. She'll turn off some and turn on others, she's a non factor far as I am concerned.

Now...who knows anything about recruiting for the new EPA clean air rules? THAT is a campaign story with some meat in it!

She went PUBLIC with the help of the Statist Democrats and ceased as a private citizen in her testimony...and she wen further on the 'Talkshow' Circuit.

Flucke is part of Obama's "Wag the Pill" campaign, or better known as "The GOP War On Women".

First they dropped the hammer on the Catholic Church.

Then they bring this woman up to tell her sob story

Then they release this HBO movie "Game Change" to attack Sarah Palin.......because Rush attacked Flucke....it's only fair

Then they release an ad calling Sarah Palin a racist and beg for money to stop her.

It's pretty despicable if you ask me. Obama thinks he has a license to steal.

I can't say they planned it all this way, but the White House is behind all of this.

Palin gets in front of every camera she can find; no comparison with a "civilian".

She is eager to oblige; Obama responded to one of her insults. No candidate to oppose, yet, and possibly not until AFTER Tampa.

Of all people he releases a campaign attack ad on her and not the other candidates. She is a civilian and not running for office as of now. In watching the ad it is apparent that Governor Palin is actually correct in her statements. All I can say is that Obama must be scared that she will force a brokered convention and it looks like it might happen the way the GOP pundits are talking. This attack ad clearly defines a sense of insecurity coming from the Obama campaign pertaining to her.

Nothing to do with Private...or otherwise...YOU expect me to swallow the same yaksqueeze with your succeeding posts.

IF she isn't such a danger as the left keeps telling us?

WHY do you keep following her? Salivating on her every word in an attempt to discredit?

WHY don't you let it die if she is such a non-factor?

SHE is dangerous to you and the other leftist idiots.

SHE has left her indelible MARK upon you...and you leftists see that as a vendetta against the Conservative she is.

Deal with it.

I know rightwingnuts would loooooove for her to go unanswered because you're not supposed to tell when a rightwingnut is lying.

(the answer is... when they're moving their lips).

It's not about "insecurity", it's that apparently, there are people who actually believe her nonsense.

She could always stop lying. *shrug*

Objecting to the the most powerful man in the world running ads attacking people he is supposed to protect is not the same as defending the person who is being attacked.

Just something to think about, you might find the thought that presidents, who can send the FBI, IRS, or any of dozens of other agencies, after people, should not attack anyone just because they disagree with him. Chavez started out by attacking people who said things about him, then he started taking their businesses, and then he started locking them up. I do not want to see this country go down the same road.

</quote>

Since we were talking about Obama, not the Police Chief of Berkeley, the conclusion was pretty easy to get to.
For reference, I think that the police chief should be fired for that.

But I would have no problem with the Police Chief buying an ad on TV to refute the article.

<quote>
I know, it is easier to ignore the first steps and wait until we are already slipping down the slope. Just remember, by the time he arrests Palin it sill be to late.

</quote>

This is exactly the point I was trying to make.

Since when is releasing a political ad "the first steps" to Obama arresting Palin?

The "slippery slope" argument is nonsense in this case. Now, if you were making an argument that some of Obama's additions to Executive Powers, and continuations of the Patriot Act were a "slippery slope", that I'd agree with completely.

Running an ad? Not quite.

<quote>
People in the military loose theirs as soon as they sign up, why should the Commander in Chief be any different?

</quote>

Because they are different. The CoC isn't subject to the UCMJ. If you want to change the Constitution, feel free to lobby your local representative to write an amendment that strips the sitting President of his first amendment right.

<quote>
Still missing the point? He has more power than they do. If a local mayor suddenly took to the press to attack a local activist who was making life difficult for him the press would have a field day.

I tend to avoid discussing meaningless "what ifs". But I will say that if I was the local activist, being called out by the sitting mayor would be the best day of my life.

I think the root of all of this is simply a difference in political philosophy, which is something that neither of us is going to convince the other of.

I believe that people don't lose the right to speak their minds just because they become a public figure. It's as simple as that. I accept the point that you disagree - and that's fine. Neither of us is going to convince the other.

As long as we're considering paid TV advertisments "free speech" (which is a whole different matter), I see no reason that the President's re-election campaign can't go after the people that are going after him.

It would be a different story if Obama was attacking Palin or the Kochs from the White House Press Room - but why should the President's campaign be subject to rules that the opposing campaign isn't subject to?

If you're saying that Obama's had some PR issues with his use of the bully pulpit, I won't disagree with you.

The difference is that I'm not "connecting the dots" Beck-style. I don't see it as a larger manifestation of some deep psychological disorder, I just chalk it up to a new President not completely comfortable with making statements. Every President has had their issues with that.

I've never said that Sarah Palin was stupid. She's far from stupid. And it's not that Obama is handing her the White House - he's keeping her relevant.

Sarah Palin doesn't want the White House, she wants a talk show on Fox. She wants people to keep caring about her opinions, and paying her to tell them. It's a lot easier and more lucrative to get paid to talk about politics than it is to do them.

And in that sense, Obama is absolutely helping her.

So it's okay to call anyone who campaigns against Obama racists???

Obama says he doesn't want anyone trashing his kids. He says we need to tone all of this angry speech down.........then the prick turns around and pays for an ad calling Sarah Palin a racist. What does Palin have to do with anything? Why release that HBO movie now?

This is all about silencing critics. Obama is no different than Rush Limbaugh. He's decided to trash Sarah Palin, a woman, and made a point of trashing her even after he called his political prop, Sandra Flucke, and apologized for Rush trashing her. The whole process has been a setup for these attacks against Palin.

What a piece of shit.

There is a strong implication in the timing of the flick "Game Change" being released around Super Tuesday that Obama and his team thought Palin would be involved in the election more than she is, and they still think so.

All that didn't come to pass but the recent dust-up about contraception made it "a go" with the Palin add because "they" (the Obama agents) believe that Palin is despised by women generally and it is good strategy to undermine her power base any way they can.

A brokered convention is possible as a result of the way delegates are proportionally allocated in the early races. If so it will include a roll for Palin, or so it would seem, and that possibility can't be lost on the Obama schemers.

It may be that the so called movie (actually a propaganda hit piece) may inspire outcome opposit from what was planned. It may be seen for what it was and cause sympathy for Palin.

Hitlery Clintin

Hillary Rotten Clinton

Hildabeast

Her Thighness

Hillary "that buck-toothed witch, Satan."

Men won't vote for Hillary Clinton because she reminds them of their nagging wives.

This is Clinton's testicle lockbox. It is big enough for the entire Democrat hierarchy, not just some people in the media.

She sounds like a screeching ex-wife. And -- and -- and I don't say that -- there's nothing against ex-wives or women. I'm just trying to be descriptive here for you.
Men will know what I mean by this.

will Americans want to sit around and watch a woman age that rapidly before their very eyes on television every day, as president of the United States?

when Hillary Clinton speaks, men hear: Take out the garbage

Sorry but Celebutard Palin HERSELF has approved all of MessiahRushie's retard slurs, which he started long before Rahm emanuel!

Are You Capable of Decency, Rahm Emanuel?
February 1, 2010
CELEBUTARD PALIN: Rahm’s slur on all God’s children with cognitive and developmental disabilities – and the people who love them – is unacceptable, and it’s heartbreaking.

February 4, 2010
RUSH: I'm just going to read the definition of 'tard' to you in the Urban Dictionary.: "Adjective used to describe ones so retarded they do not deserve the r-e."

February 8, 2010
RUSH: The satire is easy. It's simply telling everybody who you really are and what you're really all about," and the left to this day still has no sense of humor. This business of Rahm Emanuel using "F-ing retarded " to describe his own radical leftist Democrats for getting in the way on health care and so forth... I never used the word. I never once used the word! It never crosses my mind to use the word.

RUSH: So here is Rahm Emanuel stepping in it big time, and I thought I would just make fun of it. And you wouldn't believe the left out there thinks -- independently of Emanuel -- that I started using the word and that Sarah Palin should demand that I get fired, just like she did of Emanuel

August 1, 2008
RUSH: This ad's working. This ad's working. They're not going to throw him under the bus. He's exactly right. She looks at the term celebrity as a pejorative. See, they are so offended. That's why they're out there saying, "This is going to diminish McCain. This is going to make him look small in so many people's eyes." Wrong. It's correctly identifying Obama -- and his audience! His audience is a bunch of celebutards, and he's a celebutard, and they know it. If they are so concerned about how this is diminishing McCain, then they should ask McCain to keep doing these kind of commercials. If these commercials hurt McCain, why, they ought to be out there saying, "Great ads, Senator! You need to expand on this theme that Obama is nothing but a celebutard. "

November 4, 2008
RUSH: Well, it depends on the celebutard in order to answer this question. For example, Oprah. You look at Oprah. She's a billionaire, right?

February 4, 2010
RUSH: They're trying anything to get Sarah Palin. From Andrea Mitchell, NBC News, Washington, to everybody else at MSNBC and Margaret Carlson of Bloomberg, oh, they're all trying to get Sarah Palin to denounce me just as she did Rahm, and if she doesn't do it she's a hypocrite, they're saying. She knows that I do this kind of thing. Sarah Palin is a lifelong listener to this program.

February 3, 2010
RUSH: But our politically correct society is acting like some giant insult's taken place by calling a bunch of people who are "retards," "retards."

RUSH: Now, Emanuel is taking his contrition one step farther -- hosting a delegation of advocates, including two people with mental disabilities, at the White House." They're going to have a "Retard" Summit just like they had the Beer Summit.

February 7, 2010
WALLACE: OK. But Rush Limbaugh weighed in this week. And he said this:"Our politically correct society is acting like some giant insult's taken place by calling a bunch of people who are retards, retards."

CELEBUTARD PALIN: He was satirical (ph) in that --

WALLACE: Wait a minute, let me finish.

CELEBUTARD PALIN: OK.

WALLACE: "I mean, these people, these liberal activists are kooks." Should Rush Limbaugh apologize?

CELEBUTARD PALIN: They are kooks, so I agree with Rush Limbaugh.

WALLACE: But you know what some people are going to say, Governor, and have said. They say, look, when it's her political adversary Rahm Emanuel, she's going to call him out, he's indecent, apologize. But when it's a political friend like Rush Limbaugh, oh it's satire

CELEBUTARD PALIN: I didn't hear Rush Limbaugh calling a group of people whom he did not agree with "F-ing retards. " And we did know that Rahm Emanuel, it's been reported, did say that. That's a big difference there.

February 16, 2010
PALIN: He was using satire, using the 'r-word,' so he could bring to light what is was that Rahm Emanuel was calling other people

Ron Paul Wins First Caucus: MSM Changes Rules, Reports Romney Wins

Republican presidential candidate Ron Paul secured his first caucus victory over the weekend, by winning 29 percent of the popular vote among the people of the U.S. Virgin Islands. However, the mainstream media decided to report that despite coming in second with 26 percent, Mitt Romney was the real winner.

The Republican Party of the U.S. Virgin Islands reported the results as ?112 to Paul (29%), 101 to Romney (26%), 23 to Santorum (6%), 18 to Gingrich (5%),?

In response, The AP and other mainstream reports yesterday claimed that Mitt Romney won caucus, because he stands to come away with more delegates. <a href="http://www.infowars.com/ron-paul-wins-first-caucus-msm-changes-rules-reports-romney-wins/">Continued</a>

the answer is....no. It's been about the popular vote win. Now, it's about delegates. Will ron paul win any contests? Here is one, but the delegate rules for V.I are complex and Romney got the GOP delegate pledge, so Romney gets the headline.

The point is, no matter what, ron paul is the loser. If he grabs more delegates, he didnt win the popular vote and is guilty of stacking delegates. If he wins the popular vote in a contest, he lost the delegates to the pledge GOP and therefore, did not win.

We're pointing out the irony of the MSM. Every contest up until this, it's been about who won the popular vote, and that Paul hasn't been able to do that in any of them. Now that he finally does, they pretend the popular vote isn't the important aspect, but who won the delegates...which is odd, considering Paul has been winning a majority in many of the caucus states.

No, many delegates in the caucus states wont be decided for a while. Delegates claims on wins in the news are mainly guesses. Right now, the media is focused on popuular vote winners for this reason, while they make ASSumptions regarding delegates. Except of course, if Paul wins the popular vote.

At the precinct level, yes.

That doesn't necessarily mean he wins the majority of the states' delegates that go to national, but it puts him in the best position to win the most possible.

For example, if Paul wins 75% of delegates in the precincts of a specific county, then he has a significantly better chance of winning the next slate of delegates chosen at the county's convention. This in turn sends the majority of delegates on to the state convention, where the final slate of delegates is chosen to represent that state at the national convention. So winning majority delegates at precinct level basically gives you a huge advantage over your opponents, because delegate selection is majority based at the conventions.

Not-so-independent logic there. it isn't about the nominee. It's about fair journalist practices and reporting the events without displaying a deliberate bias. Something our media has shown us they can not do time and time again.

Looking like the choice? It was decided before the primary even began. Still that has zero to do with the integrity of independent journalists reporting the news as it happens. Why not just say Obama wins in November now since he's looking like the United States of Amnesia's CHOICE?

Save us all some time and king him now.

I guess this idea of journalist integrity really is lost on most people. Oh, well.

Why would Avatar do that?

That would mean giving concession to us by admitting it is media bias against Paul. Which would make one have to start actually learning about the rules of the game and not drone zombie media soundbitess, and could make one realize that the game is rigged. Which would probably not sit nicely into the boxed in thinking of most people.

</quote>

Well he constantly ridicules Paul for his earmark position, and I've probably explained the position at least 3 or 4 different times and everytime he never responds further, but will show up in a different Paul thread at another time and continue to criticize him on it.

</quote>

At the precinct level, yes.

That doesn't necessarily mean he wins the majority of the states' delegates that go to national, but it puts him in the best position to win the most possible.

For example, if Paul wins 75% of delegates in the precincts of a specific county, then he has a significantly better chance of winning the next slate of delegates chosen at the county's convention. This in turn sends the majority of delegates on to the state convention, where the final slate of delegates is chosen to represent that state at the national convention. So winning majority delegates at precinct level basically gives you a huge advantage over your opponents, because delegate selection is majority based at the conventions.

Ah. Well as far as that goes, the press has been EXTREMELY unfair to Ron Paul from the start. I don't dispute that at all.

Yeah, and the GOP have been caught cheating in this primary. If the press gave him equal consideration, his "real chance" at the nomination would at least be fair. That is, he came out strong in Iowa, NH and so on. But is repeatedly marginalized by them and not given the same coverage as the others.

You APaulcolytes are funny. Paul never had a chance and all your whining about it, doesn't change that. He has tried this how many times? He has come in first in how many primaries?
But I get it. Your definition of an Independent is someone who agrees with you. Your definition of logic is agreeing with you. I see it from "internet people" all the time.
Ron Paul is truly great in some ways but when he f-ks up, he does it big time. And he does it often.
The other thing APaulcolytes can't seem to handle or accept as reality is this: The majority of Americans simply don't want what your guy or Libertarians have to offer.
Time to go into denial or do the usual "You hate liberty! You're a statist! You're Establishment!" or whatever flavor of tantrum suits you.

Paul has just as much of a chance as the others should the playing field be equal. But it isn't. It's rigged. Both in the primary/caucus and in the media representation of the events.

There hasn't been a female president either so I guess by your "Independent" logic they aren't worthy either. Just because something hasn't been achieved doesn't mean it isn't worth striving for.

Oh and you don't speak for everyone and everyone isn't wrong.....just you. Sorry to break it to you. Paul has polled strongly against Obama and one poll recently showed him beating Obama by more than Romney would. So actually many people do like Dr. Paul.

You yourself made a thread about how Paul hasn't won anything yet and you feel sorry for him.

Now he wins something and you're making fun of us for calling out the media bias in regards to it?

At the precinct level, yes.

That doesn't necessarily mean he wins the majority of the states' delegates that go to national, but it puts him in the best position to win the most possible.

For example, if Paul wins 75% of delegates in the precincts of a specific county, then he has a significantly better chance of winning the next slate of delegates chosen at the county's convention. This in turn sends the majority of delegates on to the state convention, where the final slate of delegates is chosen to represent that state at the national convention. So winning majority delegates at precinct level basically gives you a huge advantage over your opponents, because delegate selection is majority based at the conventions.

</quote>

You're seriously going to tell me that Paul is winning the delegates at the caucuses?

</quote>

Yes. I've read news stories from local news outlets and watched countless video being taken at various different conventions in the caucus states and Paul is in fact winning a lot of delegates. He's got an overwhelming majority in Nevada, for instance.

Ah. A reasonable reply. I have no problem with Ron Paul - I actually like much about him. But some of his followers are complete whackjobs - like the guy who started launching insults (which I don't initiate but I do return) because I dared dispute his holy messiah could possibly be behind in the delegates, and Evil Ming the Merciless has rigged every primary in every state and so on... You do not seem to be "You're not voting for my guy so you hate freedom, you *@/##^*!!!!" type of Ron Paul supporter.
I have no doubt about RP doing well here, in Nevada. I have met more Libertarians since moving here, than anywhere I've ever lived. I can easily acknowledge that Ron Paul has many delegates but do the majority of Americans want him as president? No. If they did, the Libertarian party would be as big or bigger than the Dem or GOP parties. But it's not. It's just that simple. So who knows? Maybe Paul should have more delegates than are currently on the board but there is no way in hell that he would be in the lead.

I don't think anyone is saying Ron Paul is in the lead right now. Who can say what might have happened had things gone differently in Iowa though. There have been several states where the results are questionable and appearances matter to the masses. What if the media gave him the attention it gives the others? Again who can say how public opinion might be influenced by that? When you say that the american people don't want Ron Paul to be President maybe you are right but shouldn't the playing field be equal so they are given a fair chance to decide? The american people are being manipulated and this election cycle is a glaring testimony to that fact.

I agree completely. I remember when he was in third and they kept interviewing Bachmann - who was in like, 27th place or whatever.

How come Ron Paul can't win over more Republicans? Santorum, Romney and Newt all got 30 and Ron Paul got 8%? How come Ron Paul supporters can't win over more Republicans? You can't blame the media. Everyone has gotten a good look at Ron Paul and pretty much made up their minds. What is it that Republicans don't like about Ron Paul?

And Ron Paul fans. Stop arguing with us liberals if you can't even convince conservatives you are sane. The only things we like about Ron Paul, the conservatives hate. Go figure that one out?

But I do notice that Ron Paul supporters and Mitt supporters rarely argue about their differences.

Here is what they avoid discussing. Ron Paul fans admit the bankers are corrupt. But they don't seem to understand that so too are the other mega corporations and billionaires that run our country. Groups like ALEC now write our legislation. Citizens United. What do Ron Paulers think about Citizens United? I bet not much. All they ever seem to say when I mention the Koch brothers or the Adelman is LESS REGULATIONS. Without much thought behind the talking point.

What do Ron Paulers think about lobbyists? Its eems like less regulations is the cure all for everything. Doesn't make sense to anyone. Well, 92% of Republicans don't agree with him. That's enough for me.

Its not just the bankers that are the problem, its the oil ceo's and healthcare ceo's and Mitt Romney Bain Capitals and NAFTA and Free Unfair trade and tax breaks to the rich that bankrupted this country.

Oh, and Ron Paul'ers also understand the corrupt Military Industrial Complex. I give them that one too. Another reason why Republicans don't like Paul. They love war. They love military spending but not social security. That's unconstitutional.

I had forgotten how this thing works about giving credits and taking credits from the little light meter up there.

Willow, I was only pointing out that this is probably not a criminal offense. The violation, according to the article, is the fact these recordings didn't properly identify themselves. At least not to the satisfaction of the person writing the article. This writer claims that because he doesn't know who "The 99% Womens Group" (or who ever these people are) is, that this violates the regulation that robocalls must identify who is sponsoring the call. It's just really thin to begin with and in addition, I don't see where any kind of charges have been made, much less has anyone been been convicted of anything and even if that were the case, it's not something covered by "criminal" code. We don't generally refer to speeders as criminals. Or any number of civil infractions or misdemeanors. Had the author of this topic said "illegal activity" then I wouldn't have raised a peep. But "criminal" is just misleading. No criminal offense here.

And that's a very thin statement to base a judgement of illegal on, much less criminal. The group did identify itself, the author just claims there is no known group by that name. Well.... known to whom?

They have to be incorporated somewhere. They have to have at least of 503(c) application on file. And the failure to provide the callback number is defined as illegal. It may be a misdemeanor instead of a felony, but it is still illegal.

You note from the article that they block access to the return phone number.

They are definitely in breach of laws on fun raising too, if no one knows of them.

I don't disagree with you. I'm actually holding you to the letter of the law and this isn't criminal. It's not a criminal violation anymore than a parking ticket is a criminal violation. We separate criminal code and civil code for a reason. The letter of the law says this isn't a criminal offense. Your title is misleading. No crime here. No criminals. Perhaps some "violators".

From Section 5:

(B) Criminal fine Any person who willfully and knowingly violates this subsection shall upon conviction thereof be fined not more than $10,000 for each violation, or 3 times that amount for each day of a continuing violation, in lieu of the fine provided by section <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/47/usc_sec_47_00000501----000-">501</a> of this title for such a violation.

No one has been even formally accused of anything, much less convicted. There is no criminal conduct here that has been even remotely verified. The group may very well have a 501 app pending. We just don't know. Calling this criminal is just inflamatory hyperbole, at the least, premature.

You make good points but I'm not sure all this digging up of bones helps out. Don't get me wrong, I don't care for Rush but I think it's wise to judge incidents on their individual merits. The fact that these calls were about Rush shouldn't have any bearing on their standing as compliant / non compliant with the regs on these things. If they are a violation or even "criminal" as our poster suggest, that should not be based in any way upon the subject matter of the call.

So the remedies are civil unless the person "willfully and knowingly" does this. Only then does it rise to a "criminal" fine.

I don't think we have any evidence that shows any will or specific knowledge to intentionally break the law: This is nowhere near the criminal level at this point. We have no reason, at this point, to call this criminal. Again, it's just hyperbole used for effect. We all know this. There have been no charges, much less any official word that this is believed to reach a "criminal" level.

Ok but.... whether or not people like Rush is kind of irrelevant. If you guys want to debate the merits of listening to / not listening to Rush, I suspect there are ample topics here from the Rush / Anti Rush fan clubs.

I think this topic was about the legality of some robo calls. There are some technical aspects that say you can robo call but you have to properly identify yourself. These people did identify themselves but whether or not they satisfied the law is in question. As well, I question any claim of "criminal" activity. I think they have probably violated the regulations but nothing that appears to rise to a level considered criminal.

I don't think we have any evidence that shows any will or specific knowledge to intentionally break the law: This is nowhere near the criminal level at this point. We have no reason, at this point, to call this criminal. Again, it's just hyperbole used for effect. We all know this. There have been no charges, much less any official word that this is believed to reach a "criminal" level.

Right.

From Section 5:

<quote>
(B) Criminal fine Any person who willfully and knowingly violates this subsection shall upon conviction thereof be fined not more than $10,000 for each violation, or 3 times that amount for each day of a continuing violation, in lieu of the fine provided by section <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/47/usc_sec_47_00000501----000-">501</a> of this title for such a violation.

I would say that the law directly contradicts your claim that ignorance is no excuse. It specifically says that they had to know they were breaking the law in order for this to be criminal.

Therefore, if they were ignorant of the law, they are still guilty of breaking it, yes, but not to rise to the level of a criminal offense.

being on the pill does not make you a slut. Lots of women use it to control menstrual pain. The pill isn't really that effective either. The Palin daughter who got pregnant did so while on the pill.

The issue is no her use of contraceptives, despite being a student at a catholic college. The issue is she wants the taxpayer to pay for them.

We can't afford to pay for our roads and bridges and the schools are having budget cuts etc etc.

The government is paying way too much and too many priorities are skewed, but paying for a rich kid's contraceptives is not where the money should be going.

I looked at a version of that law: <a href="http://transition.fcc.gov/cgb/policy/TCPA-Rules.pdf">http://transition.fcc.gov/cgb/policy/TCPA-Rules.pdf</a>

It does NOT appear to make the conduct illegal.

It does appear to make it unlawful.

The distinction is one of criminal law versus civil law.

Violators can be sued. It does not appear to me (at least on first reading it) that the law contemplates criminal prosecution.

Yet for exercising his free speech, Rush is now (if dip shits Gloria Allred were to get her way) supposed to get arrested. <a href="http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0312/73829.html">Gloria Allred seeks Rush Limbaugh prosecution - MJ Lee - POLITICO.com</a>
Yep. She's fucked up.

The left is pretty whacked out. (No. Not all on the left. But the reaction to this Rush incident is way out of whack and the reaction does come from some -- maybe even many -- on the left.)

I'm not sure if that's a deliberate mis-characterization or you just weren't listening beyond what your political masters told you to do.

It is not the act of USING birth control that makes one 'a slut'. The shear amount that Ms. Flucke claims is NORMAL brings into question her reasons for using so much since you can get a year supply for far less than 1000 bucks, and condoms even less so.

Secondly, is your daughter demanding that someone who would find her act of using birth control morally reprehensible, is responsible to pay for it? That's what Ms. Flucke is demanding as well as her defenders, apologists and useful idiots are.

On a similar note, I feel the same way about Bill Maher, Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert. None of them are worth listening to either, and I seem to only hear about them by accident when they say something extra noxious the left loves so dearly as protected free speech.

The automated calls are illegal because they do not state who they are from (there is no known group called The Women of the 99 Percent) or provide a callback number, as required under the US Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991.

I looked at a version of that law: <a href="http://transition.fcc.gov/cgb/policy/TCPA-Rules.pdf">http://transition.fcc.gov/cgb/policy/TCPA-Rules.pdf</a>

It does NOT appear to make the conduct illegal.

It does appear to make it unlawful.

The distinction is one of criminal law versus civil law.

Violators can be sued. It does not appear to me (at least on first reading it) that the law contemplates criminal prosecution.

Yet for exercising his free speech, Rush is now (if dip shits Gloria Allred were to get her way) supposed to get arrested. <a href="http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0312/73829.html">Gloria Allred seeks Rush Limbaugh prosecution - MJ Lee - POLITICO.com</a>
Yep. She's fucked up.

The left is pretty whacked out. (No. Not all on the left. But the reaction to this Rush incident is way out of whack and the reaction does come from some -- maybe even many -- on the left.)

</quote>

Yep. She wants him CRIMINALLY prosecuted.

Oh I hope she does try this and ends up getting hit with a countersuit so had George Soros's teeth hurt by proximity.

Right. And it appears to be a violation, but a violation is not necessarily criminal. The remedies state that only in the case of "knowingly and willingly" violating the law, is a criminal fine imposed. And even then, it's just a fine. It's a technical provision at best. Claiming that "the left" is "criminal" is just an unnecessary over dramatization. There is something here but all this back and forth and trying to criminalize each other wholesale just doesn't help us figure out how to solve our issues.

Seems to me it is knowingly...and not criminal eh? Can they be subject to civil penalties for the violation?

I'd say they are absolutely up for a civil penalty.

Right. I understand. So, if they were completely ignorant of the law, all together, then they could not have possibly "knowingly and willfully" violated that law: Not an offense of the criminal fine variety.

Knowingly and willingly, as used here means that you knew the law and violated it anyway. It doesn't mean that you accidentally robo called people. I mean, you are trying to tell me that we have a law that covers people who accidentally robo call people? Just not so. You're reading the law in a completely wrong way. The law doesn't say "knowingly and willingly" because we thought someone might unknowingly and unwillingly set up a robo call campaign. That's just absurd. Just like you asked earlier, what, do we have a problem with people in a trance setting up robo calls? Of course not.

Rush has silenced himself for those who are smart enough not to listen to his hatred for the working class. I have gone over the whole scenario. My daughter is on the pill. Therefore she is a slut in his eyes. I give his opinions about as much thought as I give Bill Maher or whatever his name is. Both are the same. Neither is worth the effort to turn the station to listen to them.

</quote>

being on the pill does not make you a slut. Lots of women use it to control menstrual pain. The pill isn't really that effective either. The Palin daughter who got pregnant did so while on the pill.

The issue is no her use of contraceptives, despite being a student at a catholic college. The issue is she wants the taxpayer to pay for them.

We can't afford to pay for our roads and bridges and the schools are having budget cuts etc etc.

The government is paying way too much and too many priorities are skewed, but paying for a rich kid's contraceptives is not where the money should be going.

Grey is formed by mixing black and white... Sooooo it's not really something else is it? Just like cold is the absence of heat and dark is the absence of light, evil is the absence of good. The good may be small in comparison to the evil, but it is none the less good, and it does not become less nor does the evil become greater. Like shade is formed when light is blocked or is too far away to illuminate. It is still some light.

But there is an absolute zero, as well as absolute dark. It is quite probable, there is an absolute evil.

Yeah, there is all sorts of potential just laying around waiting to be realized. Most of us don't make a habit of stating potential as fact though: "My son is a concert pianist" When actually he isn't. He just asked if he could take lessons... but I sure see the potentia l. Like wise with your topic stating that "the left" is "criminal". It's a broad statement and you support it with something that only has the potential to be criminal.

It's just thin partisan carrying on man. No hard feelings but it is what it is.

</quote>

Again, I'm only living down to the thin standard the left lives by. Do you have a problem being held to your own standards you use against conservatives?

</quote>

I don't have any sort of feelings one way or the other as far what standard you live down to. It's not personal for me. And I sure am sorry if it appears that I am using anything against conservatives. I just now supported Rush's right to say whatever he wants to say. I really try not to put my dog in the liberal vs conservative arena these days.

I see what appears to be civil violation of the code regarding these robo calls. To use that to say that the "left" is engaged in "criminal" activity doesn't seem like a reasonable statement to me. That's all.

Thanks for the interesting conversation in this topic, I'll move on now.

Willow, I was only pointing out that this is probably not a criminal offense. The violation, according to the article, is the fact these recordings didn't properly identify themselves.

The CONz are really stupid. It is like watching the Three Stooges or the Marx Brothers. Obama and his people are playing them like a fine fiddle. This "War on Women" real or percieved is going to catch them by surprise..even though every pundit with any credibility on both sides is sure of it and is desperately warning them of it.

They go on and on about free speach...OR they did it too or first or whatever.... It is mind boggling how they think they can win this war or argument or propaganda campaign. I think what it boils down to is that they in fact do not take women seriously. Somehow they do not believe that women will turn out in much greater numbers in November. They will pay dearly for this willfull ignorance.

Fuck... do you have ANY idea how many robocalls I got in 2010 from Republican SuperPacs with dumbfuck names like "Taxpayers for Prosperity" and the like? They called me on my phone and talked about Obama's anti-American Agenda and how Chris Carney is Obama's Lapdog(in so many words).

Welcome to the Post-Citizen's United World... if it's good for the Goose, it's good for the Gander.

I don't agree with it, but it works both ways.... and it's YOUR side that got this Steaming pile of shit rolling... so blame yourself.

Ahh so this IS the new talking point. "It's all Citizens United fault."

Horse shit. More attempts to link dissimilar concepts to obfuscate the truth.

Very good Alinsky tactics, but it ain't working this time.

And that's a very thin statement to base a judgement of illegal on, much less criminal. The group did identify itself, the author just claims there is no known group by that name. Well.... known to whom?

If the group can be identified by this name, there is nothing even illegal, much less criminal.

I don't think that citing other incidents of this stuff make the next incident OK.

But on a related note, I recall getting a robo call from one of these groups on my cell phone. I answered and this recording began asking me if I was tired of irresponsible democrats spending my money without my approval.... and suddenly I realized that these jerks had called me, on my dime, without my approval. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/cuckoo.gif"/>

In this we kinda agree.

Best defense against robocalls on the cell is to not answer a number you don't know. IIRC it's a hefty fine per phonecall if you turn them in.

True, "Women of the 99%" don't exist and no number was left... but then, my cell phone records the number from which the call was received and I'm sure that number can be traced to who owns the line.

My guess is that whoever set up the calls doesn't know the law and if they did, they would have made the calls fit the requirements of the law. Not excusing ignorance of the law, just thinking that they were probably not trying to be deceitful.

Most people know there are rules to robo-calls.

She? Really?

I am just re calling how all this rep stuff works so I'm not really sure how to tell what the offending remark was. I haven't participated here in a few years and I really had forgotten how rude and mean spirited the place is. I have made an effort over the past years to adjust my internet etiquette to some other forums where many of the posters here wouldn't be allowed into the conversation based on poor manners and bad taste in dialog. A little sarcasm can go a long ways but with all this open hostility, I don't think a forum like this one really stands to foster any kind of understanding or reconciliation between people with diverse ideas. In fact, it just appears to be a place for people to kind of mentally dump on one another. I doubt I will stay much longer than my first visit or be missed anymore when I am gone.

</quote>

I was asking you if she neg-repped you for saying "It may violate civil code of some sort but there is no criminal offense here."

</quote>

I don't know if that is why she sent me a bad note. I know I got one and one of the little yellow lights went away. But then I got some good notes and more little green and yellow lights came on. And then this person called me an "ass wipe". And then when I apologized profusely for whatever I said to offend this person, I was called a liar and she made some sort of joke about a tissue at my expense. Quite strange actually.

</quote>

Well, it looks like she did, then. That's some pretty petty shit on her part.

Good job once again, Willow.

Explain how Citizens United is even relevant. AFAIK PACs (when registered) already were not affected by this. This unregistered, unauthorized group is violating the law, and CU is not a covering for it.

But do keep trying to misconstrue the argument.

Impressive. My liberal parents just got one of these illegal calls. Needless to say, they were shocked to learn from me what's going on.

Of course, they hung up on the call 5 seconds in.

I wish I could say I have never deliberately broken the law, but then my offending right foot would probably crumble up and fall off because I tend to drive faster than the speed limit.

Filthydelphia?

I'd rather you not use that word to describe that city. Last week, I sent a resume to Camden, NJ, right across the river from Philadelphia. The job looked perfect for me! But alas, I was probably 1 of 500 resumes and haven't heard back from them.

I never thought of moving north of the Norfolk, VA area, but that job looked exactly like the one I want. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/cry.gif"/>

Not if, its already past tense. Of course she knew I was joking but she already knew that Limbaugh was an over the top name caller who thinks he could give me a lesson in politics when really its totally the other way around. But I did let her know he did use this language. She got a chuckle out of it. And shes still on the pill. Pay $5 a month for it via her insurance. I think shes paying enough.

I'd rather you not use that word to describe that city. Last week, I sent a resume to Camden, NJ, right across the river from Philadelphia. The job looked perfect for me! But alas, I was probably 1 of 500 resumes and haven't heard back from them.

I never thought of moving north of the Norfolk, VA area, but that job looked exactly like the one I want. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/cry.gif"/>

Hehe,

What I was hoping for was someone to say, "Hey, I live in Camden, what job did you apply for?". To which in PM I would have told them. Then, of course they would say "I know the Executive Director, perhaps I could put in a good word for you?" and from there, the job would be mine. <img src="http://www.usmessageboard.com/images/smilies/cool.gif"/>

You never know, it seems that there are only two ways to get a job these days. Knowing the right person or B*****g the right person and I refuse the second option.

And that's a very thin statement to base a judgement of illegal on, much less criminal. The group did identify itself, the author just claims there is no known group by that name. Well.... known to whom?

If the group can be identified by this name, there is nothing even illegal, much less criminal.

I think the whole fiasco is nonsense but....

I suppose the right is just calling bullshit like the leftists do...

I suppose this time it is actually "illegal" probably a law manifested by democrats...

It started in the 1960's where the radicals expected tolerance while they slapped those who held themselves to a higher standard. They got used to it, and now, they are rapidly losing that double standard to act like animals and NOT have their own tactics used against them. They're finding it very distastful, and not so much fun when it comes back to bite them on the ass. Its kinda like they got used to playing on 'rookie' difficulty, and now have been forced to play on 'normal'.

It's not fun when you keep losing when just a few short games before, you could walk all over the enemy without repercussions.

I was agreeing with you in an oblique angle. It's not hard to see people on the right getting fed up with the double standard and using the tactics of their enemy against them. PhoenixOps is trying to shame us for using the same standards as they do. Sorry, but I'll wait for them to feel shame for using those tactics first. I'm done tolerating the notion that I should be ashamed while they continue to use the same tactics over and over again. Gaining ground in this nation in the arena of public discourse because they don't justifiably get popped in the rhetorical chops now and again to keep em honest.

I remember a scene from "Cinderella Man" when Braddock goes up against Henry Lewis, IIRC. "Pin him in a corner and keep hitting him. He idn't gonna like it." Apparently this is what needs to be done to the left.

Of course. It's your standard. Why should I use something else? I don't see a conviction. I find only the case dismissed after 18 months.

So he's not guilty of anything. Isn't that the case for your heroes?

You're whining again. Go pay attention to your list.

I've picked up that you're a vicious one when you take a position and not likely to even soften on a statement in public. And I apologize up front for bringing your statement to task. However, the idea that you will relinquish your shame because someone else has shed theirs is how we end up with no integrity at all left in the equation. Essentially, they win, you lose. The entire premise is for them to expose you as being just as rude as they are. And I suppose you have proven them right. You can't make a positive impact with this sort of logic. My God man, pull yourself together and stand up.

I'd say you are right, that dropping to their level does nothing for your cause. You surely are not going to get them to change their ways by behaving in the same poor manner.

However, he is right. Some on the left use those very tactics. Of course, the right is not excluded either and it is not just because the other side did it first. It's human nature.

I agree with you. But continuing to point out that the other kid on the play ground did it first, or continues to do it, does not reclaim your shame. Bend over and pick it up. It's that easy. Are we going to stand here over our dignity, beneath us on the ground and both continue to say "no... you pick yours up first?"

I'm not swearing or ranting or taking a political side here. I don't think decency has a side. You and I Immanuel, just agreed that a good place to start is to reclaim our shame. And this looks like as good a place as any to start.

As far as the issue, it's all protected speech. And if we would all just reclaim a little of our shame, a little of our manners, I know that I for one would be a little less ashamed of standing up for your speech. I stand up for Rush's right to call someone a "slut". I stand up for Mahaer, or what ever his name is. But that doesn't mean it causes me no shame to do so. It does. It is a SHAME that I have to defend that sort of speech to keep my own.

You make the mistake that I never have taken the high road or the polite path and just agreed to disagree. I do, frequently with those who have the same attitude and honor. Unfortunately, I have hit the end of my tether with many on this board and other places where they constantly engage in hypocrisy and exhibit no regret or shame for their behavior. Well, I'm sick of it and feel it is time they received the golden rule back. That rule meaning (since it's not automatic people remember it) "Treat others the way you wish to be treated." Many of the people here you see fighting against one another have been doing so for years and often many other boards. You don't know what kind of squabbling has gone on since say 2006 like I have for instance, that's before I was invited here.

To quote Elliot Ness, "I have become what I despise and yet I am convinced I have done right." Is he right? In WW2, we, as a nation adopted the policy of City Busting to destroy enemy morale. We learned this from the acts of the Germans a la WW1 and 2 when they bombed London severely. The fortunate nature for us was we were too far away to receive the return fire, otherwise, who knows? Maybe we would have found another policy. Again, does that make the tactic wrong? Of course, this is rhetorical 'combat' here. But in the same way, we are committing the same 'sins' as the era of the founding fathers. The main difference is, that instead of this being shouted out at the local "King George Pub", church steps and town hall where you could conceivably be beaten or killed for real, you don't have that worry. We all can hide behind user names and keyboards safely away from any real danger of backing up our convictions with our own fists and blood if necessary. Are the passions any less than years gone by? I'm not sure.

I'm not particularly partisan to anyone or party and my comments aren't meant to be political. There aren't any charges, much less any conviction and I do believe in innocence until guilt is proven, old fashioned as it may seem. Even then, this is likely a civil offense and not criminal. We have particular designations for "criminal" acts and generally we don't refer to civil violators as criminals.

If a robot called me to denounce anyone, I wouldn't listen long enough to even find out who it was. I tend to hang up on robots, they don't really care one way or the other. As far as anything about President Obama, I don't really like or dislike him. He's been just Ok, far as I'm concerned. I'd prefer to see a better leader, but he hasn't been terrible.

Rush in retrospect made a poor choice that was hurtful, one for which he apologized.
Fluke rejected it. And as we discovered she rejected it for purely political reasons. Fluke reaped financial rewards over this.

I am not taking vengeance though, it is a rebuke. I am treating them as they would those they disagree with. But I shall answer in kind.

Proverbs 1: 29-31

Since they hated knowledge and did not choose to fear the LORD,
since they would not accept my advice and spurned my rebuke,
they will eat the fruit of their ways and be filled with the fruit of their schemes.

Proverbs 17:10
A rebuke impresses a man of discernment more than a hundred lashes a fool.

Proverbs 19:25
Flog a mocker, and the simple will learn prudence; rebuke a discerning man, and he will gain knowledge.

Luke 17:3
So watch yourselves. "If your brother sins, rebuke him, and if he repents, forgive him.

Titus 1:13-16
This testimony is true. Therefore, rebuke them sharply, so that they will be sound in the faith
and will pay no attention to Jewish myths or to the commands of those who reject the truth.
To the pure, all things are pure, but to those who are corrupted and do not believe, nothing is pure. In fact, both their minds and consciences are corrupted.
They claim to know God, but by their actions they deny him. They are detestable, disobedient and unfit for doing anything good.

So, take what you will from it.

Rush calling a woman a slut when she whines about needing to pay for birth control in addition to her $30,000/year private law school bills, is just analyzing the situation. She must sleep with so many men to not be able to afford birth control....so she is a slut.

Meanwhile Bill Maher, calls Palin a slut and makes fun of her retarded child for what reason? Did Palin sleep around and demand free birth control the past few years to be called a slut? What did her child do to be made fun of?

That is the point, liberals are scum calling people names whereas people like Rush just make an observation about someone putting their face on TV with behavior consistent with a.....slut.

I find two things interesting in your critique.

First, that I'm arguing over some vainglorious matter of honor. I am not. I know that many people here that are the target of my ire will not change their minds. It's not their minds I hope to change, but others who read silently. I don't know if you notice, but many people read these threads who are not members or have hidden themselves. I've received notes from them off and on in the past for making points or causing them to think differently about a situation. It's not often, but enough to let me know that those people are the audience, not the other bloke 'in the ring'. The method is not vain, it's just not for the benefit of the target unless they have actual intellectual honesty, and that is sadly lacking on this board.

Secondly, it takes a man to stand up instead of letting fools and charlatans just run rhetorical roughshod over you because to stand up for your beliefs, truth or just plain historical fact is impolite. Depending on the discussion, this is the course to take, but here? No. If you want to get compromise, find a nice heavily moderated board in which you agree with all the time, and will protect you from dissension. You are not going to shame me into silence by questioning my manhood.

Lastly, I bolded and highlighted Boncher's Maxim in my signature below. I live by it and know full well it's repercussions.

That is the point, liberals are scum calling people names whereas people like Rush just make an observation about someone putting their face on TV with behavior consistent with a.....slut.

You don't have the right to force Christians that oppose birth control to pay for it through their organizations.

You would not force muslims to serve pork in school......or eat it. You're just a fucking hypocrite and a liar.

Rush let his inner voice go out over the radio and most people listening were probably thinking the same as him.

Maher just calls Republican women names with no substance behind it because he thinks it makes him look cool and intelligent, when in fact it makes him look like a piece of shit that would be lucky to make it out alive from a bar. He hides out in Hollywood but he might walk into the wrong bar someday and his big nose will get pushed up into whatever little brain he has.

Fitz my friend, there is simply no way to convince us that your enemies have dragged you into the mud they wallow in when you've been offered a hand up out of it and refused. This isn't a difficult concept to understand.

The matter on both sides is covered by protected speech. Now it's just a matter of how low we can set the common denominator. There is no glory to be had here, there is no "win". There is no need to put yourself in this position. Those that will see your point already well have. The rest are not going to come around, much less by this method you have chosen in your attempt. I applaud your conviction but your method is in vain. Again, pull yourself together and stand up man.

</quote>

I find two things interesting in your critique.

First, that I'm arguing over some vainglorious matter of honor. I am not. I know that many people here that are the target of my ire will not change their minds. It's not their minds I hope to change, but others who read silently. I don't know if you notice, but many people read these threads who are not members or have hidden themselves. I've received notes from them off and on in the past for making points or causing them to think differently about a situation. It's not often, but enough to let me know that those people are the audience, not the other bloke 'in the ring'. The method is not vain, it's just not for the benefit of the target unless they have actual intellectual honesty, and that is sadly lacking on this board.

Secondly, it takes a man to stand up instead of letting fools and charlatans just run rhetorical roughshod over you because to stand up for your beliefs, truth or just plain historical fact is impolite. Depending on the discussion, this is the course to take, but here? No. If you want to get compromise, find a nice heavily moderated board in which you agree with all the time, and will protect you from dissension. You are not going to shame me into silence by questioning my manhood.

Lastly, I bolded and highlighted Boncher's Maxim in my signature below. I live by it and know full well it's repercussions.

</quote>

I'm not a big fan of moderation, I prefer a civil conversation with reasonable, voluntary respect for one another. I'm not sure where my earlier comrades are, I will try and bring them to the conversation, but a few of the regulars here just yesterday made an excellent plea that we recapture shame. I thought it was a fine, Christian idea.

At any rate, I'd ask you think about this: I have stuck with you in this conversation and made a little investment in the conversation mostly because you seem like you might be a decent fellow that I want to hear out. But what you have just told me is that rather than respond to a polite and reasoned plea for your courtesy, you choose to carry on, in spite of my polite and reasonable debate, in hopes of influencing someone who you aren't even sure is listening? I find that rather disingenuous, wouldn't you say? If your intent is to influence people, why have you overlooked me? I've been right here, I haven't scoffed or insulted you, I have listened and responded politely and considered your opinion. I have offered feed back of a most reasonable and pleasant nature. And yet, you are prepared to disregard and any chance you have of of influencing a person who is ACTUALLY ENGAGED with you, so that you might instead ramble on with this conversation to the choir?

I won't give up on a more civil conversation Fitz. It doesn't serve me, it serves you my friend. I have no other reason to be here.

Fitz, you aren't hearing me I don't guess. You can't win my respect, or many other folks respect, by pointing to rationalization or causation for bad behavior. You have an opportunity to lead by example. This excellent tool we have here is your podium. Trust me, you can have a greater impact by adjusting your speech according to YOUR convictions and values, not lowering it to someone else.

It takes time, but you are an intelligent guy. I just ask that you try. Not all at once, but try.

I'd love to see shame in the conversation more. There are a few on the right, but far far far FAR more on the left who need it desperately. I am a fervent enemy of double standards and hypocrisy, even though I know at times I've engaged in both. That's why that maxim is the way it is, and I've yet to find anyone who can find a flaw in it. We can only minimize the subjects and scales in which it is exhibited in us.

Yes, you have taken on a much more moderate tone, but I still see the claws and left handed compliments too. I am not blind to nuance. I have in the past been able to influence some of the people I've talked with, this is true. I've been influenced at times as well. But I also am not going to back down from my conviction for fear of offending someone with what I find factual. I like the quote from David Gerrold in one of his "War against the Chtorr" novels.

"The truth will set you free, but first it will piss you off. by Solomon Short"

You have questioned if people are listening to my diatribes. It varies. But with as many guests reading threads, at least someone out there is seeing it and learning something. Nobody knows the size of the footprint anyone has in any public conversation. There is always a surprise in who's listening. This is as private a conversation as a televised debate, and although most who see it won't comment, your comments as well as mine go a long way.

I'm sure that many won't notice the same things I do. For instance, I find the condescending tone taken as if to chide me like a parent does a child a bit.... distasteful, but none the less there. The same way you probably find my abrasive nature to be problematic. It could be unintentional, and possibly some of the ways you view my words are not as I intended. It's the reason why online conversation is not as good a medium as we may think.

In person, I'm fairly certain we'd be able to get along and maybe even personally like each other regardless of our intense political disagreements (assuming there are) on various topics. I know most people who meet me have said I'm charming witty and erudite. Of course I warn them I'm rude, crude, socially unacceptable, twisted, rotten and nasty; and those are my good points.

C'est la vie.

Fitz, I am sorry if you felt "chided". My intention is not to chide anyone. If you did like I have and left this place a few years and then came back, you'd probably be appalled, as I must admit I am. I am not saying that to insult or hurt anyone. I am just being honest. The level of conversation here is below the moral fiber that most decent people will tell you they aspire to. And that is not a left or right statement. It's a statement from someone who has made an honest effort at improving myself and the people around me. I work a lot with the public, I belong to a lot of web communities. It is difficult to say without some here taking it personal but this is as vile and uncivilized a group of folks as I ever came across, regardless of which political flag is being flown under the name.

I guess that is kind of "chiding". Be that as it may, there is a more effective way to communicate than what we have here.

Apparently the left in general doesn't get bias if they agree with it for one. That said, the source does not change the facts of the issue. A leftwing group IS committing the crimes it mentions.

Also, Alinsky's rules are not going to change the fact that your own standard sucks when you are forced to face it yourself. I'm done with double standards, so I will use your standard on you.

Yes, we know the left doesn't accept apologies from any rightwing figure. The left just doesn't bother to apologize for its actions. Although P-BO has apologizing for the evil American Empire down pat.

Dude, the "right-wing" part wasn't even the important point, it was the "Blog" part.

Who knows what was said in the cut-out portion? Could have been anything.

I don't know. I fail to see much good intention anywhere in any of it. It's all lowest common denominator stuff that I would think decent people would try to rise above, on both sides of the issue. Attempting to correct bad behavior with more bad behavior and then excusing all that bad behavior by pointing to yet more incidents of bad behavior... that's not good behavior. Know what that is? That's more bad behavior.

What does disappoint me somewhat is that just yesterday I had two or three fairly senior members here agreeing that reclaiming some shame for bad behavior would be a good idea. Also mentioned was the act of leading by example. And I found these to be excellent examples of good, Christian behavior that I can believe in. Unfortunately, those posters have yet to recommend those things to anyone but me. They seem remiss about mentioning those values in this conversation. I don't question their sincerity. I don't question them at all. I just notice their absence and think it could be appreciated in a conversation like this, as much as it was appreciated in the prior conversation when it was my behavior put out there.

<post author="louis-t" datetime="2012-03-13T10:16:00" id="p1">
Source: AP

Rick Santorum told attendees at the Gulf Coast Energy Summit in Biloxi, Mississippi, on Monday to trust his judgment on the environment, highlighting his position on climate change?that is, that it's a liberal myth.

Gingrich, for his part, also took the anti-Obama baton during his speech to the same summit Monday. " very anti-fossil fuel administration," Gingrich said. "The left wing environmental movement hates oil."

the continuation of animal life, but if anyone has done an analysis on that (including the other carbon sequestration), I haven't seen it - it might be an impossible calculation given all the unknown parameters. <img src="http://www.democraticunderground.com/emoticons/shrug.gif"/>

They are able to send missions to Mars but did not know about CO2.

Tell you what, Santorum, what would happen if there were NO CO2 on the planet. You can work you way up to global warming in 3 simple steps.

a) Too little CO2, the planet is cold and uninhabitable.
b) Just enough CO2, the planet is inhabitable.
c) Too much CO2, the planet is too hot and uninhabitable.

It is a little like the three bears. That should be understandable by even a kindergartner.

Then you can come to the conclusion that CO2, besides being used by various living entities in different ways, is like a giant thermostat.

42. You could apply that to all elements in our atmosphere.

I like your example. Like, if we had more oxygen in the atmosphere, people would start acting confused and disoriented. Add a bit more and their skin would start to redden and inflame (right after failure of the cardiac/respiratory system). Oxygen is a flammable, corrosive element. If you added even more, the bombardment of daily meteor and space debris in our atmosphere would probably have fires raging continuously on the planet. Creepy.

Romney Rules Out Santorum as Veep
</headline>
<post author="brooklynite" datetime="2012-03-12T22:21:00" id="p1">
Source: Political Wire

Mitt Romney told Fox News that he would not pick Rick Santorum as his running mate because he's not conservative enough.

Said Romney: "Well, that would preclude, of course, Rick Santorum. Because, I mean, look at his record. I find it interesting that he continues to describe himself as the real conservative. This is the guy who voted against right-to-work. This is the guy who voted to fund Planned Parenthood. This is the person who voted to raise the debt ceiling five times?... Rick Santorum is not a person who is an economic conservative to my right."

There are two novels that can change a bookish fourteen-year old's life: The Lord of the Rings and Atlas Shrugged. One is a childish fantasy that often engenders a lifelong obsession with its unbelievable heroes, leading to an emotionally stunted, socially crippled adulthood, unable to deal with the real world. The other, of course, involves orcs.

by Corey Dade

March 1, 2012

Portions of Alabama's strict immigration law will remain in force until the U.S. Supreme Court rules on its predecessor, the Arizona statue that ignited a national firestorm in the debate over illegal immigration.

A panel of three judges from an Atlanta federal appeals court decided Thursday to put off action on lawsuits against measures in Alabama and Georgia. Oral arguments are set for April 25 before the Supreme Court over the constitutionality of Arizona's enforcement policy.

Alabama, Georgia, South Carolina, Utah and Indiana have passed legislation modeled on Arizona's. The Justice Department has sued to block all the laws, arguing that the role of enforcement belongs solely to the federal government. Human-rights and immigrant-advocacy groups have filed separate suits claiming the laws violate individuals' civil rights.

The Supreme Court is expected to rule on the Arizona law by the end of its term this summer;...

SEND TO DEATH

The deportation of a convention refugee to a place where his life is in danger is against the International treaty signed from the USA
As a victim of torture, I was developed Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)and my need for protection is a necessity protected from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugee (UNHCR) that give me the status of MANDATE REFUGEE under the Refugee Protocol International Protection.
After an interview that hundred of American legal organization are contesting right now as a UNFAIR INTERVIW I received the denial of asylum in the USA
Without a safe place to go, the only choice was to live illegally in ??The land of the free?? I was doing for living, as my own private business, working as a freelancer as a landscape design, audio design and latter as a captain and boat dealer in San Francisco Bay.
At this time I was tax payer and great appreciate for the business and design that I do.
Eventually my driving license was checked at a traffic stop and arrested because I WAS WANTED NATION WIDE FROM THE IMMIGRATION for not presenting my self for DEPORTATION TO DEATH !
From San Francisco I was send in a CONCENTRATION CAMPUS owned from Correctional Corporation of America (CCA) and rented from the Immigration and Custom Enforcement (ICE). The huge amount of money that the CCA take from the government is not my business. The degrading way that the immigrants are treated and abused is to push the innocents to crime or mental affection to be easily deported as a ??criminals?? or ??mentally insane??.
In my condition as a Mandate Refugee facing the deportation to death, that I live without crime in the US just to save my life, I start to see the imminent horror future intensely.
The effect of past torture reactivate my PTSD I start having again nightmares and flashback
And seriously I start thinking about suicide as a better alternative then to drop in the hands of people that I run from and to be tortured again and kill at the end
The US government Intelligence, that organize in Romania rendition center as a program of collaboration for FIGHTING AGAINST TERRORISM, know very good : The Actual Romanian Government do not play around and I will be death
WHY ?
The US Government do not want to recognize never any wrong doing
Do not want to admit the corruption of government officials (judge Joan Churchill )
THEY WANT TO SEE ME DEATH
I was put in front of Psychiatrist John Lee that have the mission to destroy my brain
With hazardous and constitutionally illegal medicine like OLANZAPINE to make me easy deportable. I do not take it. The deportation officers was surprised when they come to take me
My reaction was not typically to an individual under Olanzapine
One of them was asked : HE DO NOT TAKE HES PILLS ?
John Lee born in Korea and get the job with the Homeland Security as the best place
To exercise his hate toward immigrants, the place to perform his own mental problem and to make big money
The place where he can do anything against immigrants and the crime become legal as a LAW ENFORCEMENT
By bad luck I informed miss from Florence Project, that totally unprofessional do not keep the confidentiality between client attorney and Lee get the message
He understand instantly the danger that he become expose if those information will go to media with everything that is going on at Eloy Detention Center
The crocks that give bad name to the United States and totally disrespectfully abuse the money taken from the good American people start to scare
Over night I was deported to cover this CRIME AGAINST HUMANITY
Slavery. Human Experiment, illegal administration of psychotropic or antipsychotic.
Slave trade. incarcerate or sending innocents to death or life endangerment and degradation.
Are in total disrespect of US Constitution. US Criminal Code, The Human Rights and the Refugee Protocol
Disrespect for everything that the US stand for
With the generosity of ??THE LAND OF THE FREE?? I was 3 years in jail. without crime
I lose my property of over 100 000 $. I lose my wife, my friends, and I was send to death
The good think. I know the law and the officers that escorted me are out of jurisdiction of US when out of US territory
THE BAD !
All countries are acting insane when is about US involvement
Do I have to live all my life in insecurity as a ??Internationally Protected Person?? ?
Or is better to kill my self to make all happy ?

The book was also printed in a foreign capitalist country and of course not very accepted in the communist country where I was living. Was the History of Religious Ideas by Professor Mircea Eliade. At 15, I was all the time in company of university students, just because I do not get to many subjects in common with kids at my age. Maybe because I was not to pretty and tall and I was trying to get a social success by learning and doing things better. I was so young and I start reading The Castle and the Trial By Kafka. Was a hard reading ! I get the picture of a world that is dying. When I was finished Nineteen Eighty-Four by George Orwell, I just look with other eyes at the communist countries?.. And I rediscovered my own ! Later I was reading another book written in foreign country, Secret India by Paul Brunton and I get the temptation to learn Yoga. Was not hard to found a Guru.
Yoga was not to popular in Romania. I extended my social contacts with strangers that share same mind by using a little trick. I take with me in a transparent plastic bag, two of the MOST WANTED BOOKS ! That trick work great ! When I was 22, many great people from art, culture, science and education was friends with me. I was the youngest guy in those people society.
Eventually some tourists from Switzerland, was bringing to Romania the concept and the practice of Transcendental Meditation. The concept was very appreciate in Yoga circle that increase the number of members (with my help) and was promoted to the level of Board of Education in idea to be part of learning process for the benefit of students. Great ! I continued my mission to select and bring now, new members for Transcendental Meditation.
SELECTION ! what that mean ? only people with high intellectual quality and understanding.
Do I have to say ? all the people that I selected ? graduated university or was university students ? At the end, the Transcendental Meditation listed over 4000 people ! I was learning my self, social psychology and I reach the level at by looking in the subject eyes and using simple ??naïve?? questions, to evaluate, very good, a person. To discover, clearly, things about that person, that he or she never tell to anybody. At some level, all of us know, all of us have the desire to improve the life, culture and society in Romania. All the members can invite another members. The group was infiltrated with people from Romanian Intelligence (Securitate) and all those people give report to them organization about daily activity.
At them level they estimate our activity as a High Potential Dangerous maybe because
All of us was dreaming to an open cultural society. Was a mass arrest with interrogation
Of all the members listed with the Transcendental Meditation. One of the question was : WHO SHOW YOU THE WAY THERE ? And many of them answer: RUSU CONSTANTIN
I was arrested and tortured for confession! To tell them everything. I was hospitalized after torture and my life was changed forever. My house was watched, my phone intercepted. All my old friends that know my problem insolate them selves, then me.
Some of them was arrested and interrogated about Why? They visit me ? How they know me?
The fear keep those people away and I become lonely. By chance I meet totally new people
That don?t know my past. I have periodically home searching and THEY was looking for books, documents and phone numbers. They do not get any. I start writing my journal in total secrecy and to do very secret researching about the Securitate, them members and location, particularly the people that tortured me. I use all my technological knowledge (I am educate in that) to get them. I was dreaming, maybe some day those people will be punish for Crime Against Humanity if some how the Romanian system will change. WAS NEVER HAPPEN !
And, Will be never happen. The system was change but those people are protected for life !
BECAUSE THEY JUST TO THEM JOB IN GOVERNMENT SERVICE !
I want to run away from Romania, from persecution, but I have not place to go. No body outside. The majority of people that fled Romania, they do not do nothing in them place to improve the life in Romania. They are cowards ! I do not like them. They are country traitors!
Eventually, in my absence, my house was searched again and they discover in very hidden place, my journal, with my opinions that they have not time to read because I was coming back home. They show me what they found ! Was clear ! A journal with private addresses of Securitate members and my exposed desire to be punish, IS MY END ! I have not time to think to much and I fled Romania in nowhere.
Many of Securitate members fled Romania after revolution and ask for protection in exchange for collaboration, all around the world and even if that is against the Refugee Protocol, to give asylum to people implicate in Crime Against Humanity ! many country take them as exchange of experience with people trained in INTELLIGENCE.
Do I have to say ? Those people give information to them new country about who I am ?
And is better to be deported for them own safety?
?.and I am deported from all countries that take those criminals. By using dirty legal tricks !
Even if the United Nations give me status of ??INTERNATIONAL PROTECTED PERSON AS A MANDATE REFUGEE !

RUSU CONSTANTIN

Arab League: Syria commits crimes against humanity

Source: Associated Press

CAIRO (AP) ? The Arab League chief says the Syrian regime's killing of civilians amounts to crimes against humanity and is calling for an international inquiry.

Nabil Elaraby said Tuesday that it would not be ethical or moral to allow those behind the killings in the cities of Homs and Idlib to get away with their crime.

Syrian opposition activists have claimed that Syrian regime forces have killed scores of civilians, including women and children, in opposition strongholds over the past two days.

Imam killed in Belgian mosque attack, police say

Source: CNN

(CNN) -- An apparent arson attack on a mosque in the Belgian capital killed the institution's imam and left another person injured, a police spokeswoman said Monday.

A suspect was in custody in the deadly fire, which occurred about 6:45 p.m. (1:45 p.m. ET) in the Anderlecht neighborhood of Brussels, police spokeswoman Marie Verbeke said. No further details about the suspect were immediately available.

The 46-year-old imam is believed to have died of smoke inhalation, while the surviving victim was treated for the same thing, Verbeke said.

This particular mosque has received threats from radical muslims in the past, and the man arrested is purported to be one of them.

5. His comment is interesting though, and it shows that even on the left Americans see..

most things around the world as somehow relating to the US. I´ve noticed this, and it has nothing to do with ignorance. I think it is because even your liberal media, like Democracy Now has a much more introspective view of things than European media for example.

For example, just about everyone in the US thinks the Occupy movement started in the US. But it actually started in Madrid, and has become an english-speaking world phenomenon as such. The Spanish are still at it though.

6. I agree.

I think that it's an American thing, regardless of politics. We seem to think that the world DOES revolve around us. It may surprise many that it doesn't. I also agree about the Occupy movement. I was in Europe in June. I have family in Spain, France and Belgium. Barcelona is one of my favorite cities and I observed that people were occupying parks there and throughout Spain demanding jobs.

We are a great country, but we are not the center of the universe.

Bradley Manning's treatment was cruel and inhuman, UN torture chief rules
</headline>
<post author="go west young man" datetime="2012-03-12T10:50:00" id="p1">
Source: The Guardian UK

The UN special rapporteur on torture has formally accused the US government of cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment towards Bradley Manning, the US soldier who was held in solitary confinement for almost a year on suspicion of being the WikiLeaks source.

Juan Mendez has completed a 14-month investigation into the treatment of Manning since the soldier's arrest at a US military base in May 2010. He concludes that the US military was at least culpable of cruel and inhumane treatment in keeping Manning locked up alone for 23 hours a day over an 11-month period in conditions that he also found might have constituted torture.

"The special rapporteur concludes that imposing seriously punitive conditions of detention on someone who has not been found guilty of any crime is a violation of his right to physical and psychological integrity as well as of his presumption of innocence," Mendez writes.

"Regardless of what it may be called"- I'm glad Mendez has made this point as our gov't is constantly trying to rename things to make them more palatable even though they are horrible things.

Obama says repeatedly that he stopped the practice of torture but there continue to be reports of the continuation of extraordinary renditions, etc. not to mention the treatment of Manning.

I guess Obama's DOJ doesn't consider solitary confinement prior to conviction torture. I would suggest it is.

3. It's not just Bradley Manning

Low estimates are that there are at least 20,000 people in solitary confinement in high-tech dungeons like the federal Supermax prison in Florence, CO, and the rancid Pelican Bay complex in northern California.

The ACLU considers solitary an abuse of human rights:

Here's the thing--if Manning was tortured, I would expect interviews from him and his lawyer, and a careful review of his Article 13 claims. Of course, Occculus, you have reviewed the Article 13 claims and motions of the defense counsel, have you not?

Quantico is a single-cell confinement facility. Too bad Mendez chose not to visit him.

12. He asked to visit him unmonitored.

Quantico denied the request. The UN special rapporteur ask's all countries for unmonitored visits. That way it can be ascertained if he was mistreated without worry of retribution from the confining authority. To spin your words. "Too bad the United States (chose) not to comply with his request". All the pressure did bear fruit in the end as Manning was transferred to a medium security facility. Too bad it took so long and so much handwringing. The whole confinement debacle has just put one more stain on the already tarnished reputation of the United States and our armed forces.

39. I see and understand you believe fully in the US law.

However, the UN is the international deliberative body for the entire world. Every country has it's own laws. They are not all just. As a matter of fact many of them are completely different than each other. Great Britain, for example, has no plea bargaining and actually considers the U.S.' use of it a travesty for justice. The UN attempts to deal with all these differing systems and asks all countries for the same courtesy. In this regard the U.S. is not special even though you believe it to be. It's a paradox as the U.S. should aim to set a higher standard so that other countries would follow. I would argue that your defense of this practice by our country is actually not in the interest of the United States. Other countries will now follow our poor example and we will be worse off for it. As will be future U.S. prisoners of war.

there is a specific UN treaty that permits unsupervised visits by the UN special envoy on torture. The US did not ratify that treaty - we have no obligations under international law.

11. Vote a straight democratic ballot?

Not that I object to doing so, in fact, I intend to do mostly that, primarily for ideological reasons - principle. I'm confused though, as to why anyone thinks that would make a difference in such cases. Do you think Obama could halt or change the treatment of Manning even had he wished to? Executive power is not all it's cracked up to be. There are forces in the military, within the MIC, that even the President must be wary of. He may be Commander in Chief, but he is neither King nor dictator. He is simply the Chief Commander - first among equals. To the extent of my knowledge he does not have military experience either (correct me if I'm wrong). I imagine he relies mainly on what his experts, his generals tell him.

It was not just the Republicans that allowed for this treatment, it has never been so. Democrats, even some of whom we admire allow this to continue because they either believe things are being done appropriately, or are afraid to take on the MIC. Accidents happen, even to the most wealthy and powerful officials. Keep in mind we still have no clue who actually killed JFK, or why they really did so - plenty of theories, but nothing concrete.

If we vote a straight democratic ballot, it will help in numerous ways - particularly if we manage to elect more progressives. If you think though, that it will change treatment such as this... I suggest not holding your breath.

Many members of the armed services are furious with Manning. They feel that he betrayed his oath, betrayed them, possibly leaked information that could endanger a number of lives. I find that it is particularly those who have served in the field that feel this way, regardless of their political leanings. Never having served myself, I can't expect to understand their feelings of betrayal or why many of them feel that no amount of punishment is undeserved.

Personally though, I object to how he has been treated on a matter of principle. Military or not, time of war or not, there are legal protocols that should be followed in such cases. Regardless of his alleged crimes, the man remains a citizen, entitled to certain rights - to a certain manner of treatment. In a high profile case such as this (or, for that matter, in any such case), charges should be first be made, then, whether a jury trial or a military tribunal, there are protocols to follow. We should not even treat our worst enemies in such a way as to torture them. It degrades us, makes us less than we are when we allow such treatment, encourage it, or apply it personally. There is a fine line between punishing the guilty and becoming what you despise. A guard who tortures one prisoner will be all the more eager to do so again the following day... until it all but completely deprives him/her of humanity.

Does solitary confinement to this extent qualify as torture? In my personal opinion, I think it does. As law defines it though, I'm not sure. Keep in mind though that the longer an individual is held in solitary confinement, the more they deteriorate both physically and psychologically. Anyone with even a very minor grasp of psychology could explain to you how dangerous this is. Perhaps that is the intent though, if the man is declared to be insane and actually does lose his sanity, it would be far easier to leave him in a hospital of some sort for the rest of his life. He could then be quietly forgotten.

Whether we vote D or R will have little impact on this. How we personally treat others, will. How we personally raise our children, what we teach them in regards to right and wrong, will impact generations of the future until this treatment hopefully becomes unthinkable to everyone.

14. I'm an ex-marine, 0341, mortar man, 1985-88

and I feel this one soldier is the best soldier we have ever had. His actions helped bring about the entire Arab Spring and have helped expose nepotism and injustice the world over. Due to him we can possibly hope to one day have a just USA as right now the emperor has no clothes and the truth has been laid bare. "We are the baddies", as Ricky Gervais once said. The world now see's that the ruse of spreading democracy is a just that and nothing more. Our national self interest and desire to work with dictators and murderers for oil, the MIC, and the mighty dollar outweighs our desire to make the world a better place. Bradley helped bring that fact to light. And in the process helped flip 3 corrupt regimes. The US military has taken a decade to attempt to flip two and is only half way there. The one they did flip is now a shia state with a gov't that condones killing homosexuals or people who look gay. Well done America! I think Bradley's a modern Paul Revere. The British aren't coming this time. The MIC is however.

Another thing the kind of treatment he has been forced to endure will result in a softening up. And I don't blame him but I wouldn't be surprised if because of that, he'll renounce his past beliefs and reasons for doing what he did and beg for forgiveness and mercy. Especially if, away from the cameras, he gets whispers in his ear about all the continued pain and isolation he can look forward to if he doesn't comply.

I think that is what the MIC really wants. A public apology so that the MSM can safely report that all is well and the poor misdirected young man, who was taken advantage of by the evil Wikileaks, has seen the light.

37. Why would the UN cite any evidence Manning may have?

There's still been no determination or evidence presented in a court proceeding that Manning was the source of Wikileaks' information. Manning has just been locked up for months and months, kept in solitary, subjected to torture, and held incommunicado based on little more than the military's embarrassment over what the information published by Wikileaks.

It looks more than a little like the military is making an example out of someone because they can't or won't reach the real culprits or prosecute the war crimes Wikileaks' information details in such damning particulars.

27. Exposing War Crimes is NOT a Crime, READ:

In a nutshell, exposing war crimes is not a crime, it is a duty:

Principles of International Law Recognized in the Charter of the Nüremberg Tribunal and in the Judgment of the Tribunal, 1950.

Principle I

Any person who commits an act which constitutes a crime under international law is responsible therefor and liable to punishment.

Principle II

The fact that internal law does not impose a penalty for an act which constitutes a crime under international law does not relieve the person who committed the act from responsibility under international law.

Principle III

The fact that a person who committed an act which constitutes a crime under international law acted as Head of State or responsible Government official does not relieve him from responsibility under international law.

Principle IV

The fact that a person acted pursuant to order of his Government or of a superior does not relieve him from responsibility under international law, provided a moral choice was in fact possible to him.

Principle V

Any person charged with a crime under international law has the right to a fair trial on the facts and law.

Principle VI

The crimes hereinafter set out are punishable as crimes under international law:

(a) Crimes against peace:
(i) Planning, preparation, initiation or waging of a war of aggression or a war in violation of international treaties, agreements or assurances;
(ii) Participation in a common plan or conspiracy for the accomplishment of any of the acts mentioned under (i).

(b) War crimes:
Violations of the laws or customs of war include, but are not limited to, murder, ill-treatment or deportation to slave-labour or for any other purpose of civilian population of or in occupied territory, murder or ill-treatment of prisoners of war, of persons on the seas, killing of hostages, plunder of public or private property, wanton destruction of cities, towns, or villages, or devastation not justified by military necessity.

(c) Crimes against humanity:
Murder, extermination, enslavement, deportation and other inhuman acts done against any civilian population, or persecutions on political, racial or religious grounds, when such acts are done or such persecutions are carried on in execution of or in connexion with any crime against peace or any war crime.

Principle VII

Complicity in the commission of a crime against peace, a war crime, or a crime against humanity as set forth in Principle VI is a crime under international law.

The documents Manning released (if true) simply show a pattern and practice of criminal behavior. It was and is every soldiers duty to expose these crimes, IMHO.

As long as any country - including the US - has veto power over resolutions, the UN will continue to be a flaccid, powerless organization.

Aside from that, Manning joined the Army voluntarily, and then voluntarily broke the rules. He deserves to be punished in accordance with the Army regulations that he agreed to when he enlisted.

46. Hmmm...

Say you become a lawyer for a high priced firm. You sign so many contracts that they more or less own you. You go into this firm thinking that they do great work - and to all appearances this is true, their work benefits the greater good, as far as you can tell, they're helping people and making money doing it.

Later you discover that this firm is guilty of bribing government officials to keep silent about a great deal of criminal activity. Murder and theft are the least of what the higher partners are guilty of. Now... you have signed numerous contracts, chances are you also took an oath. Do you keep silent and allow the illegal activity to continue? Or would you report their activities? Attempt to stop them even knowing that legally speaking, they had you by the short hairs. Also, you did, after all, join voluntarily.. would you voluntarily break the rules?

Personally, I like to think that I would, I can't say for certain, but I hope I'd have the courage. A lot of the information that was allegedly leaked by Manning has revealed some very damning things about various world governments.

There are times when it is necessary to break the rules. Do you really think Manning deserves this treatment? Also, I strongly recommend reading post 14, if you haven't already.

UK court to rule on paralyzed man?s bid to authorize a doctor to end his life
By Associated Press, Updated: Monday, March 12, 3:28 AM

LONDON ? A British judge is due to make a preliminary ruling on a paralyzed man?s wish that a doctor be allowed to end his life.

The ruling expected Monday is on the government?s bid to throw out the case.

The case was brought by Tony Nicklinson, who suffers from ?locked-in? syndrome. Since suffering a stroke in 2005, he has been incapable of moving except to blink his eyes, but his mind is unaffected.

Because he is unable to end his own life, the 57-year-old man is seeking permission for a doctor to kill him. He communicates through a computer which recognizes his eye blinks.

2. 'Locked-in syndrome' man to have right-to-die case heard

Tony Nicklinson, who is paralysed and wants a doctor to be able to lawfully end his life, should be allowed to proceed with his "right-to-die" case, a High Court judge has ruled.

The 58-year-old from Melksham, Wiltshire, has "locked-in syndrome" following a stroke in 2005 and is unable to carry out his own suicide.

His is seeking legal protection for any doctor who helps him end his life.

The Ministry of Justice argues making such a ruling would change murder laws.

8. What if it was agoraphobia?

They would be considered "depressed." Why do we not see this guy as suicidal because he is depressed in a way natural to many of us when we are sick, sad or life is just at it's most difficult?

I am not in his condition, but the horror and emotional bias toward it is not helpful here. When that becomes the driving factor in these decisions we go down a slippery slope where decisions to commit suicide are assumed and endorsed.
Most people who are paralyzed are at some point asked (even by strangers) if they have thought about killing themselves. Is there anyone else you can think of who would be asked that by people they barely know? "So, since you look like that and can't do everything "normally" wouldn't you just rather die?" How does a decision like this influence trauma teams at car accidents?

When death is inevitable and clearly soon imminent, disagree with interference.

But if courts decide that one's experience is so horrible they can die if they want to, how soon before the suicide of people with major depression becomes normalized and the disorder itself is ignored?

There is a lot to consider, but I think going by our own perception of his experience is not the most valid perspective. I am sure the judge has other facts to consider that I am unaware of, but I am just concerned about the implications on other people.

9. look you wouldn't do it to a dog

sorry but if you wouldn't do it to a dog (keep him alive when he could only communicate by eye blinks and was begging to die) why the HELL would you do this to a human being who is in full possession of an aware mind?

keeping him alive is just cruelty, and it should not continue against his express wishes

7 years in hell unable to move and to have to learn to speak through eye blinks is just outrageous, and the sad thing is the doctor who "saved" him in this condition after the stroke probably thinks he is a hero, no vet would do anything this dirty to the smallest animal and pat himself on the back for it

we treat animals better than we treat ourselves, and yes we DO have the right (and the duty) to go by our own perceptions when he says his life is not worth living -- surely we have empathy enough to know we would not trade our life for his if he held all bill gates' gold

it IS my concern because similar stuff has been done to my relatives, one relative kept alive with alzheimer's for 20 years for the profit of a nursing home, it's just cruel and sickening

you wouldn't do it to a dog, don't do it to a human

a shadow hangs over my life because i DO have to worry about being tortured endlessly for the last years of my life, it is easy to say "oh we don't have to think about it" when someone is from a background where they've never seen this done and they figure it's a rare thing that will never touch them

14. Agoraphobia is a "locked in" mental condition

People with Agoraphobia are so terrified of being out and about they isolate themselves.

If it is appropriate for a person who is physically "locked" why not someone who is mentally locked in?

It is relevant because as soon as suicide is mentioned by a person who is walking around and considered "normal" the first instinct for anyone who hears that is to assume they are depressed and that maybe the depression should be addressed and treated.

Given that, why is it not possible that this individual is experiencing treatable depression?

If we acknowledge that possibility and still consider this act appropriate why would it not apply to any suicidal person with treatable depression, particularly if it is related to agoraphobia?

16. The two are not remotely comparable

This 'locked in' means the most significant muscle the man can voluntarily move is in his eye. An agoraphobic still has control of their body, and their home.

<post author="LeftishBrit" datetime="2012-03-14T16:57:00" id="p15">
31. Firstly, agoraphobia is generally treatable, as is depression

Secondly, agoraphobia is NOTHING like this man's condition. A person with severe agoraphobia may be confined to the house, but they can still move, talk, eat, attend to their own physical needs. This condition is extreme. Most disabilities are partial (e.g. you can't walk but can still get about in a wheelchair, and talk and eat); or, if they are anything like as extreme as this man's condition, are accompanied by a loss of awareness so that they don't realize their predicament.

Even some people in this man's position would do anything to live, but I don't think you should be forced to. This is a new situation because a generation ago, people with such severe strokes would not have lived long anyway. The powers of modern medicine to prolong life have brought about their own dilemmas.

11. "When death is inevitable and clearly soon imminent, disagree with interference"

You clearly have not had the experience of watching a loved one go through this. I did. A very dear friend had ALS. It was an aggressive type that in the end would seize up her breathing muscles and cause her to choke to death. She had already lost the use of her mouth, she couldn't swallow or speak, was fed through a tube directly into her stomach. She lived in Holland where they are more enlightened about this. There were procedures she had to go through, but in the end, she had a dignified death in a hospital with her children by her side, aided by a doctor. She did not strangle to death but was gently ushered into it.

I disagree with your statement "When death is inevitable and clearly soon imminent, disagree with interference" as it depends on how that death is going to happen. Sometimes interference is the most merciful.

<post author="loyalsister" datetime="2012-03-12T20:27:00" id="p17">
13. I worded that badly

I meant when death is imminent and certain I believe it is appropriate to (not interfere) leave those decisions entirely to the person and their loved ones.

I am more uncomfortable about going down a slippery slope that opens a door for medically assited suicide in a wide range of situations.

<post author="HeiressofBickworth" datetime="2012-03-12T21:34:00" id="p18">
15. In my friend's case

she needed two doctors to certify that she was within 6 months of death before she could obtain the medically assisted suicide. They also had to be sure she was not being coerced into it.

In live in the Seattle area -- Washington adopted a Death with Dignity law a couple of years ago. I hope I never need it, but I find it a small comfort to know that it's there should I ever find my self in my friend's situation. There are safeguards built into the law. Medically assisted suicide is not like waking up one day and deciding that it is your last day on earth. Like my friend, doctors need to certify that death is certain and within a particular frame of time. I don't see that the law is any kind of a slippery slope but is a humane and merciful way to end certain suffering.

17. Why not let the only person whose opinion matters decide?

He understands his own situation and can surely tell the difference between it and agoraphobia. Partly no doubt because, while still inside a snug hospital room, he remains physically unable to move and live a life that is satisfying to him.

He isn't, from this article at least, trying to speak for other paralyzed people, only himself. Why insult him by speaking for him and suggesting he doesn't understand his own mind, when all he can do is contemplate; or that he has not considered this statement enough, when every letter he uses takes a long time and much concentration?

18. Do you agree then,

that person who has a mental illness should be given the same benefit of the doubt? Or in that case is it worthwhile to question their desire to commit suicide?

My reservations are related to the broader issue that can not be ignored when this issue comes to the forefront.

I can see in 15 years or so my relatives saying, 'Bill's depressed, he can't work, but hey, assisted suicide is an option.' I struggle to see in practice a system of assisted suicide that will guarantee vulnerable people don't end up being assisted quite aggressively. In other words, I'm not sure that so-called informed consent will work in the way advocates of assisted suicide claim."

...... It may seem rather bleak to suspect one's own relatives of exerting insidious influence of that sort ? albeit dressed up as the most altruistic concern; but unfortunately the country does not consist entirely of families happy to pay whatever it takes to keep an elderly relative going even if that means that their hoped-for inheritance is swallowed up by that same relative's care-home fees.

<a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/dominic-lawson/dominic-lawson-why-the-disabled-fear-assisted-suicide-2297116.html">http://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/dominic-lawson/dominic-lawson-why-the-disabled-fear-assisted-suicide-2297116.html</a>

Complicated financial conditions apply to people who are much younger. Home health care costs for people who have CP or spinal cord injuries can be quite a strain on a family budget. State funding is not always available. Do we develop an idea that it is simply responsible for disabled people to commit suicide because they require some extra resources?

My reservations come from the contemplations of people who fear what may happen to the perception other people have of them. I think it is a legitimate concern. State budgeting in many states are notorious for cutting resources for people who have disabilities. We are very aware of the fact that we are devalued even by well meaning people. I am not trying to start an argument. Only pointing out reasons why some people are cautious about this issue.

At what point does empathy become a decision that is "obvious" to outsiders?

19. The only questioning should be done by doctors and next of kin

But the only final decision should (not does, I know) rest with the patient as long he is capable of making decisions. Mental illness only rarely deprives people of that ability. Even (most of) the mentally ill should be granted control of their own life. I just don't understand the drive to make people choose between living a life, their own one life, that they have deemed worthless, and taking usually violent and always risky steps to end it themselves when perfectly peaceful and certain methods are an Rx away. Not your specific drive by the way - a generic point.

23. I guess you don't have clue one of what I've "seen"

Do all people who see the same things agree?

Am I suggesting that people, almost any people, who reach the considered opinion that their life is intolerable, can explain why if it isn't blindingly obvious as in this case, and maintain that decision for some reasonable period of time after repeated reflection, be allowed to die without pain, risk to others, or interference from passive-aggressive guilt trips?

Yes. Hell yes. Fuck yes. A thousand times yes.

If you've "seen" so much, has it really never included a life not worth living to the only person who should matter - the one living it? The one you seem to want to remove from control of their one true inalienable possession - their own life? Trust me I've seen that, and I could never stomach inflicting that torture on somebody else.

24. My concerns are not personal

They are about setting precedents and further devaluing people who are constantly fighting to stay alive. If this conversation reveals anything it is that there are people who have to convince some that their lives are worth living. It is a waste of money for personal attendants. Where would those freaks go anyway? Of course they want to kill themselves. They would be better off if they had died in the first place.

I guess your libertarian ideas could reduce the need for mental health services and some of those freaks could be easily pressured to believe their life sucks too much to live. That should have been Ron Paul's answer about the kid in the coma. "By not waking up his body is saying he doesn't want to live. Let's save some money."

25. You really are behaving appallingly now

There is nothing 'libertarian' about what dmallind has said. And neither has he, or anyone else, put this in terms of money to look after people, whatever their state. This is about whether someone who has clear mental command, but whose physical illness is such that they cannot possibly take the step of ending their own life, can ask someone to do it, as untraumatically as possible, for them.

No-one is devaluing people who are fighting to stay alive. I cannot see where the hell you get "there are people who have to convince some that their lives are worth living"; no-one is saying that any category of people have lives not worth living. This is about individuals with extreme physical problems who have decided they don't want their own life to continue.

Your strawman arguments are getting ridiculous and offensive. If you can't argue without insulting DUers, then don't argue at all.

26. If you would like confirmation of my points

go to a state that is making cuts to services for people with disabilities. They cut oxygen. It was only available in hospitals and nursing homes until a court shot it down.
Understanding and caring that living with a disability is expensive, particularly if one wants to maintain a high quality of life. It always comes down to money. Whether the concern is that they are draining resources from society as a whole or if it is just an added financial burden for the families. In my state, people with disabilities have to go to the legislature every single year to beg for funding that will provide the attendants that get them out of bed in the morning. On the house floor, a legislator claimed that "daily bread" was being taken from tax payers.

One terrible assumption we have to work with is that people with disabilities are "better off" in nursing homes. That is a step towards the reduced quality of life people pretend to understand. It's one thing to have an untreatable completely debilitating illness
YET the people who have potential to have an improved quality of life are very often treated exactly the same because nurses, orderlies, and yes family members think they must have a terrible existence because of their condition rather than being unhappy with their environment.

These are experiences of real people I know. Including some who have been asked "would you rather have died in that car accident?" "have you wanted to commit suicide?" - as they are making the most of the life they live. It is not well understood by people who have not explored the broad range of experiences of people with various disabilities. And it is especially not understood that there are endless fights for money that will allow people to enjoy life. Mental health services also require a great deal of funding. It is true that if assisted suicide were approved for people in a depressed state, it would save the state and federal governments money. Whether that is a part of one's motivation or not, they should recognize the potential abuse this could lead to when conservatives are screaming for budget cuts.

27. Your problems and concerns are nothing to do with this case

which is about whether helping someone who is not depressed, and has clearly expressed a wish to die would result in prosecution. Your argument is, at best, a 'slippery slope' one which involves a series of suppositions for which there is no evidence; but it really looks like someone who is determined to prevent suicide by anyone, ever.

29. Say it, sister!

Opposition to assisted suicide is in no way the sole province of the religious wrong. Marilyn Golden, a friend who is at least as progressive as I am, will take it from here:

<a href="http://www.dredf.org/assisted_suicide/97-DREDF-website-version.html">http://www.dredf.org/assisted_suicide/97-DREDF-website-version.html</a>

Assisted suicide strikes many people as a cause to support, when they first hear about it. But upon closer inspection, there are many reasons why legalization is a serious mistake. Supporters focus on superficial issues of choice and self-determination. It is crucial to look deeper. Legalizing assisted suicide would not increase choice and self-determination, despite the assertions of its proponents. It would actually augment real dangers that negate genuine choice and control.

The disability community bases its opposition on the dangers to people with disabilities and the devaluation of disabled peoples' lives that result from assisted suicide. Further, this opposition stems from the secrecy in which assisted suicide operates today, in states where it is legal; the lack of robust oversight and the absence of investigation of abuse; the reality of who uses it; the dangers of legalization to further erode the quality of the U.S. health care system; and its potential for other significant harms.

After addressing common misunderstandings, we examine fear and bias toward disability, and the deadly interaction of assisted suicide and our profit-driven health care system. Second, we review the practice of assisted suicide in Oregon, the first U.S. state to legalize it, and debunk the merits of the so-called Oregon model. In detailing significant problems with Oregon's supposed safeguards, we raise some of its real dangers, particularly for people with depression and other psychiatric disabilities. Third and finally, we explore the ways that so-called "narrow" assisted suicide proposals can easily expand. This article focuses primarily on conditions in the United States, though much of our discussion also applies to other countries.

It is imperative to distinguish personal wishes from the significant dangers to society of legalizing assisted suicide as public policy. The legalization of assisted suicide has many harmful consequences.

30. Thank you!

That's a good, comprehensive article. The knee jerk social libertarian position is understandable in a sense. But I think we should be willing to examine how this all connects to money in the end.

A newspaper profile revealed that Barbara Coombs Lee was "closely involved in passage" of Oregon's health plan. Oregon's governor John Kitzhaber, a former emergency room physician and the chief architect of this health care rationing system, admitted?or perhaps he was boasting?that "only three states spend less per person on health care for the poor." The British magazine The Economist praised Kitzhaber "for rationing health care in the face of limited resources" and observed that "Oregon no longer pays for such treatments as 'efforts to fight the final stages of AIDS.'" Politicians' and bureaucrats' implementation of these cost-cutting measures while they willingly fund assisted suicide amounted to a declaration of class warfare against the poor, many of whom are sick or disabled.
..... the Oregon Health Plan sent Wagner a letter saying the Plan would not cover the beneficial chemotherapy treatment "but... it would cover... doctor-assisted suicide."

Phone hacking: Rebekah Brooks arrested in Weeting probe
</headline>
<post author="UpInArms" datetime="2012-03-13T06:20:00" id="p1">
Source: BBC News

Former News International chief executive Rebekah Brooks has been arrested as part of the police inquiry into allegations of phone hacking.

&lt;snip&gt;

Mrs Brooks was arrested under Operation Weeting last July on suspicion of conspiring to intercept communications, before being released on police bail. She has also been arrested as part of the Operation Elveden investigation on suspicion of corruption.

Mrs Brooks is the only suspect among the six to have been arrested previously as part of the ongoing police operations. All the others are fresh arrests.

&lt;snip&gt;

It brings the total number of people arrested in Operation Weeting and its linked inquiries to 44.

9. It is not 'solely a UK issue'

The Murdoch media, and all that affects it, is very key to American politics and society. Possibly even more than in the UK, because we have the balance provided by the BBC (at least until the current government finds a way to abolish it), while Fox News seems to dominate more in America.

And revealing sub judice information at a public inquiry is one thing; discussing the general topic is another - as if any of us here had information to reveal that wasn't publicly available.

One of the articles News International accepted had come from phone hacking was a 2003 story in the News of the World which referred to telephone calls Law?s assistant Ben Jackson had made to him when he arrived at an airport.

It is believed the airport was John F. Kennedy airport in New York.

It is thought the possibility that Law?s phone was using an American network at the time could lead to offences having been committed under US law.

An FBI spokesman said: ?We aware of the allegations of surrounding this matter and are looking into it.?

Exclusive: Darpa Director Bolts Pentagon for Google
</headline>

Source: wired.com

Darpa director Regina Dugan will soon be stepping down from her position atop the Pentagon?s premiere research shop to take a job with Google. Dugan, whose controversial tenure at the agency lasted just under three years, was ?offered and accepted at senior executive position? with the internet giant, according to Darpa spokesman Eric Mazzacone. She felt she couldn?t say no to such an ?innovative company,? he adds.

Dugan?s emphasis on cybersecurity and next-generation manufacturing earned her strong support from the White House, winning her praise from the President and maintaining the agency?s budget even during a period of relative austerity at the Pentagon. Her push into crowdsourcing and outreach to the hacker community were eye-openers in the often-closed world of military R&amp;D. Dugan also won over some military commanders by diverting some of her research cash from long-term, blue-sky projects to immediate battlefield concerns.

18. Thanks. I could not remember the name of the program.

I'd never heard of DARPA before TIA.

--------------

The Information Awareness Office (IAO) was established by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) in January 2002 to bring together several DARPA projects focused on applying surveillance and information technology to track and monitor terrorists and other asymmetric threats to national security, by achieving Total Information Awareness (TIA).

This would be achieved by creating enormous computer databases to gather and store the personal information of everyone in the United States, including personal e-mails, social networks, credit card records, phone calls, medical records, and numerous other sources, without any requirement for a search warrant. This information would then be analyzed to look for suspicious activities, connections between individuals, and "threats". Additionally, the program included funding for biometric surveillance technologies that could identify and track individuals using surveillance cameras, and other methods.

Following public criticism that the development and deployment of these technologies could potentially lead to a mass surveillance system, the IAO was defunded by Congress in 2003. However, several IAO projects continued to be funded, and merely run under different names.

ADB warns climate change could spawn mass migrations
By Associated Press, Updated: Tuesday, March 13, 2:13 AM

MANILA, Philippines ? The Asian Development Bank is warning countries to prepare for influxes of people fleeing natural disasters as climate change exacerbates rising sea levels, soil degradation and flooding.

Natural disasters drove 42 million people from their homes in the Asia-Pacific in 2010 and 2011, though it was unclear how many of those were caused by climate change.

The study released Tuesday says one-third of Southeast Asia?s population lives in at-risk areas, including Indonesia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam.

Six of the 10 countries most vulnerable to climate change are in the Asia-Pacific. Bangladesh tops the list followed by India, Nepal, the Philippines, Afghanistan and Myanmar.

Every day we continue we are literally shortening someones future life. Be nice if people would think about that the next time they have to fly, drive or buy the latest goods &amp; gizmos from China.
I guess we should just give up and join in the fossil fuel frenzy but then I think maybe I'd like a kid tomorrow to have one more breath without horror. Maybe that is worth more than a golfing trip to Florida.

7. Actually, I believe they did a study back in 1978 saying it would happen and planned around it.

I don't remember the name of the document, but it's surfaced a few times to be commented on by others who knew about it. Mostly on conspiracy websites, but they actually had worked out scenarios for it just like they do for everything else.

Floods spurred by rising seas threaten 5 million in US

By Deborah Zabarenko

WASHINGTON, March 14 (Reuters) - For the nearly 5 million people who live along the U.S. coasts from Maine to the Gulf of Mexico and the West Coast, rising seas fueled by global warming have doubled the risk of so-called once-a-century floods, according to a trio of environmental reports released on Wednesday.

These new reports - one from the non-profit group Climate Central and two others published in the peer-reviewed journal Environmental Research Letters - offer a detailed picture of where the most severe risks are along coastlines of the contiguous 48 states.

Based on 2010 U.S. Census population data and a fresh analysis of high tide lines by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the Climate Central report's findings can be seen online at surgingseas.org

South Florida may be "indefensible" against floods caused by higher seas and the bigger storm surges that are expected to result, said Ben Strauss, an expert on ecology and evolutionary biology who is chief operating officer of Climate Central. He co-authored the two journal reports and the online report.

18th journalist killed in Honduras in past two years
AFP
March 12, 2012, 2:04 pm

TEGUCIGALPA (AFP) - A 54-year-old Honduran journalist was killed by a machete-wielding attacker, police said Sunday, in the 18th fatal attack on a member of the news media in the past two years.

Police said Fausto Evelio Hernandez, was riding his bicycle on his way home Saturday when he was attacked in Saba, some 600 kilometers (400 miles) north of the capital.

Deputy police commissioner Osmin Bardales told AFP that the journalist, who was an on-air announced for Radio Alegre, "tried to put his arm out (to defend himself) against the first machete blow and had it nearly severed."

The attacker then let loose with nine fierce machete blows to the victim's head, the police official said.

NGO urges probe of Honduras journalist killings
Associated Press | Posted: Monday, March 12, 2012 9:25 pm

Press groups on Monday called for an international investigation into attacks on journalists in Honduras after a radio host was killed by machete blows, bringing to 19 the number of media employees slain over the past two years.

Reporters Without Borders said Fausto Hernandez Arteaga, 54, of Radio Alegre de Colon was killed Sunday in Saba in the Colon province in northern Honduras. Hernandez Arteaga was director of the station's "Voice of the News" program.

The killing "shows once again the chaotic situation of lack of safety in which Honduras is submerged," the press group said in a statement. "An international investigation mission should take over the most serious cases."

~snip~
Ortiz said 19 journalists have been killed over the last two years in Honduras and said "there are neither perpetrators (arrested) nor thorough investigations."

Should my girlfriend sue her own father?
</headline>
<post author="GiveHerGoodAdvice" datetime="2012-03-30T23:39:00" id="p1">
A lot more information is needed for you.

She is really broken up about it and I don't blame her, she grew up in a very abusive household and child services did not intervene until she was 16 (her brothers were age 11 and 12). Coming from a background with her parents abusing alcohol and cocaine; physical abuse by her father; verbal abuse by her mother; and with all sorts of other craziness, she has somehow evolved into the most caring and beautiful person I have ever known. She only talks of the students she met in school from all over Africa and S. America and says "well I never had to see my parents get shot in front of me or anything - there could be worse things!" She was even instrumental in the reforming of my relationship with my own mother.

Despite the horrible treatment by her father and growing up in constant fear of him, she formed a new relationship with him four years after she was originally taken from him; and, also after he had completed his anger management counselling and probation.

She always knew she had $9000 coming to her from her grandmother who she still misses a lot even though her mother would always spew "he spent it all!" at her when the subject would come up.

He always told her he would give it to her when she started school because that was what it was for which sounded fair enough. I figured he'd have it, he owns a condo and seems to live quite a lavish lifestyle. I just never figured he'd give it up to her easily.

The subject has been going on since I got to know my girlfriend three years ago. A year ago she "showed" her the money online in his bank; and a few months ago they set up a payment plan, $250 a month. He's now $450 behind in payments! He never paid a cent in child support either.

She tries to trust him and think that she's actually got a dad who cares; he takes us out to dinner and is all nice; then stomps on her heart weeks or a month or two later. It is always something different but just as disappointing to show he does not care - or is still angry at her for whatever mentally sick reason he has. And the only reason I go to the dinners is because she really wants me to so I put on my face and go. Really what I want to do is tear this man apart and hang him from his balls.

But for her, actually going through with a lawsuit means she loses any possible chance of ever having a father. For her, this is really hard and she really doesn't know what to do. She is starting school next fall. I am trying to get a better job still, but I am not sure if I will have one by then. We are broke, broke, broke. Making just not enough to keep up with bills - at least we feed ourselves first.

She really wants the money for school but she's not sure if it'll just make everything harder having to deal with this. The amount is now $20k after interest that of course her dad didn't tell her about.

My advice was for her to write a letter to him telling him how she feels, telling him to cough it up or she will sue him. I know (and she does too) that the only way she can build a relationship with her father is that if this is out of the way. I think she knows already what she needs to do besides just wait, or do nothing.

But I was hoping some other opinions from all of you would help to shed more light on this subject for us. Thanks very much.

now $20k after interest / from $9k...
</quote>

Firstly she is not your wife, she has tried to get over physical abuse, she is trying to find her Father and your suggestion to her is to sue him if he does not cough up... That the Grandmother's money is now worth $20k and that he is not giving it to her. It may be that she banked it in his name and there is no money and given his background she knows he won't give her anything.. Her aim is to find her Father after all he did, or to be like you, take the money and then tell him where to go.. We don't know that.

My thoughts are this, threaten? Her Father? You are broke, broke, broke? I pose the question as to who you are thinking about, and for... Her or you ?

The answer is you can't choose your parents.

Money is not what makes love go around.

Get on with life get a job, try to support her let her pass and support the both of you and forget the money... It's gone trust me.

If you are seeing this as $20k, you are seeing a lottery... No child should not have a chance of finding her / his parent. Anything is possible and if not, then it's to be forgotten and alot of support is needed.

You are focusing in the wrong direction.

Unless this inheritance is in WRITING, then she is out of luck as far as suing him. If the money was given to him to set up a trust for her, then she needs to find out when she can get control of it (IF it exists)

Congrats to her for resolving this father/daughter thing. But as far as trusting him? No way.

Can she speak to a lawyer about this?

<post author="GiveHerGoodAdvice" datetime="2012-03-31T18:41:00" id="p5">
Ok obviously I missed a couple of things. But @ Found Soul, hey buddy don't be jumping the gun and assuming I am some evil kind of prick.

Firstly. This escalated when my girlfriend received a letter from her mother including a copy of her grandmother's will and papers from the lawyer my gf's mother had consulted. There is a lawsuit. it already exists. My gf is now faced with this decision and her alcoholic mother phones her once a week or more trying to push her to do it.

Secondly: I have never told my gf to sue her dad before and I would never try to coax her to do something like that. Holy hell what kinds of people do you normally deal with "Found Soul?" I feel for you bud, must be a hard road.

I know that if she does go through with the lawsuit there is a good chance he is going to go to jail. How is she going to deal with that? She sent her own dad to jail?? How is $20k going to help her in school if she is an emotional wreck at the same time? It's not going to.

But for her there's lots of unknowns. She doesn't know how she's going to react. She doesn't know if it is worth it. She doesn't want to struggle through school and this $ was left to her so she wouldn't have to. Her relationship with her dad is trying at best and he continues to break her heart, then he's nice. Then he does it all over again. She just wants it to end but doesn't know if taking him to court is the right way to end it.

What you write, is what is read. "We" are broke, broke, broke. This is her money and in my opinion if a boyfriend wants to help and ask for advise, he would write "she is broke, broke, broke". You don't come into it.. The word we, suggests it's affecting you as well and you want the money as well.

Can't read it any other way.

So, now that you have added, you are stating that you "have" told her to sue him, this time, never before. Do you think that will build the relationship? Or will it crush it for good. She'd more than likely send him to jaol in your words, your advise to her in my opinion will not give them a better relationship if this occured.

I preferred your first method.. Talk to him.

<quote>

It helps when you add the whole situation into the equation. So what does the Mother have to win if she does?

I'm not doubting you love your girlfriend, but remember this is the Internet you state "we" and talk money assumptions will be made.

And, lastly your words to me are of anger.. Keep it in check, last thing she needs is a reminder of her childhood... And, dude, I'm a female... Now who's making assumptions.

She needs to seek professional advice, she may have to let it go and cut ties totally with her family and you both may have to get part time jobs and support each other, defer school a year and find 2 jobs each, what ever it takes to survive. You can't count on anything in life, other than what "you" do to make it.

You are just a difficult person to deal with "Soul."

You make me feel as if I need to explain a whole lot of other things instead of sticking to the original point.

Yes, us being broke is affecting us. I am partially supporting her working full time while she works part time. We are not lazy. We are both actively seeking better employment.

I mentioned we are broke the first time to let you know that we are in a state of need. I say "we" because I have committed to her and her to I. We are in this together. yes we are going to marry but not until we are stable (for various reasons I need not go into). I say that because I wish I could help her more.

And again what I said to her in advice was mis-construed by you as well. You are trying to catch me in some kind of lie or something? I never told her to sue him before. Now she's got this decision in front of her, and I say to write him and tell him how she feels. Tell him she needs the money and since she knows he has it, he should do the right thing and give it to her or she will sue him. What is so wrong with that advice?

I also didn't know I would be posting in an environment of judgement, which is what your comments continue to show, with you questioning every "hole" in my story you can find. I think it's stupid. I'm done here.

@GiveHerGoodAdvice,

Without having read a part of the post - don't advise her. It's not your place to influence her one way or another in regards to something this intimate to a person.

Just tell her you will support her whatever she decides to do.
</post>
<post author="FOUND SOUL" datetime="2012-04-01T02:45:00" id="p9">
@GiveHerGoodAdvice,

That's the thing.

You just got the best advise and what I have stated as well. I am not judgemental at all, I am ensuring I get it right, people get it right... You do need only to support her, you can not advise her, you are missing the point. If "he" goes to Jail because of "your advice" and she feels terrible, guilty after trying to re-build with him now that she's older, will she look you in the eyes? Or, leave.

It's the internet, you have to explain a whole lot, or else like I said "we" suggests.

But don't deny the reality. You are working full time, her part time, you are partially supporting her. YOU can't cope. YOU need her to get this through the burden on this relationship and where it will go is too hard to cope with, won't the money help? YES it will. A part of you whether you like it or not wants her to get it and a part of all of us will offer thoughts to do so.. If we are financially suffering and you are. So, you can try to make me the bad "man" or you can accept the responsibility that you are hurting financially and this thing has become big to you as well. It's human nature who is putting you down?

Problem with truth is if it sounds bad, people retract. Why? You are hurting, suffering and trying to keep afloat paying part of her way.

See it for what it is, I'm not hard to deal with, I'm more compassionate than you will ever know.

Don't direct her, don't persue telling her to sue. Get her to seek professional advice, diss her Mother's calls and just be there, meanwhile do what you both can to survive.

Apparently, the father is custodian of this inheritance fund. He's not doing his duty. Your friend needs the funds for school/living expenses.

Your friend needs to get a lawyer to see that the terms of the will are carried out.

It's really that simple. Don't worry about Dad going to jail. I have a feeling that he has the resouces to not let that happen.

All this other stuff is BS.

Here's what the state's website says about the law:

About Kinship Legal Guardianship (KLG):
KLG is New Jersey's newest permanency option. It allows for children to be placed permanently with their extended family without the need for termination of parental rights (TPR) or adoption. This guardian "…has the same rights, responsibilities and authority relating to a child as a birth parent, with the exception of consenting to the adoption of the child or a name change for the child, while the birth parent retains the obligation to pay child support and the right to court-approved visitation or parenting time with the child."

@Butrflynet,

no all states allow emancipation of a minor. But if your state does, then you need a job, a place to live, be able to prove to a judge that you can successfully manage your own life with school and work. So it'll take you a few months to get yourself set up. You might be better off making up with Mom and Dad.

He was a very handsome man. And something tells me that he was a wonderful Daddy too. He has such a softness in his eyes. I bet that man loved all of you in the deepest of ways.

You hang in there. I think when something happens to someone that we love very much, we have the ability to keep them so alive in our hearts that they will feel as though they are right there with us.

Since I knew my oldest brother was making the funeral arrangements, I told him my dad could have military honors. He said he did not know that.
I only told him because I know my dad would have loved it and he deserved it. I was civil to my brothers and sisters even though I am not on speaking terms with them.

The Honor Guard did a wonderful job and I expressed my gratitude to each and every one of them.

I have to stop here to tell you that as the Honor Guard folded the flag and when they got to the very last fold..................................................
as we waited...........and waited..............and waited...........because she could not get that last fold in.....................and still waited.............by this time I had to keep myself from laughing...........I felt so bad for her.

The order was finally made to do it again. So, they had to unwrap the flag and start over. I felt so bad for them and I also know that they will hear about it and probably be made to practice it over and over again.
I plan to let the military know that they did a great job and try not to be to hard on them.

I think you would have wanted your brothers and sisters mentioned in your obituary. I hope I get it right and if I don't, I know you will understand.

Your brothers:
Vernon- died of cancer
Joe- I will leave out how he died
Lester- your twin brother who died of cancer
Harold- already mentioned in the obituary and also a twin

Your sisters:
Norma- died of cancer
Vera- died of cancer (twin to your brother Harold)
Reba- whereabouts unknown

I know you would have probably wanted Aunt Goldie mentioned, your brother Joe's wife, and their children, my cousins, Jerry, Rita and Ronnie (also Roger who is deceased)
When I was 17 (I think), Roger went into the Witness Protection Program so I never got to see him again.

Uncle Harold's son, my cousin Dee, should have been mentioned.

True, Noddy.

But then, we all learn to live with various pains as we get older, some of them profound. Sometimes it starts out minor and increases so gradually we just get used to it and adapt. Maybe his symptoms weren't so bad that he couldn't just put up with them until near the end.

Maybe the suddenness was a blessing.

Hi Noddy24, Eva &amp; gus,
My dad would never say anything when something was wrong. This time he hid it well.

In the mid 90's I stopped by my parents house and took one look at my dad and said get in the car, which hospital? He didn't want to go and I told him he had no choice. Either get in the car or I would call an ambulance. He got in the car. It was lung cancer and the doctor's caught it in time. He had surgery and they removed part of his lung.

When I took him back for a follow-up appointment we walked in the surgeon's office (actually this surgeon was in charge of the whole thoracic dept.) and I was stunned. It was the same surgeon who removed part of my lung when I was 19. He remembered me because he said he didn't perform many lung surgeries on 19 year old girls, especially the type of surgery I had.

I was in the hospital for 3 months and I had the biggest crush on him. I finally got to tell him that at my dad's appointment. How strange that my dad and I had the same surgeon that many years apart.

TTH, I was with my father almost to the end. The last thing we said to each other was that we loved each other. I was too upset at the time to think of what this might mean. But years later, it has left me with a good feeling--a feeling of closure.

Your being with your father at the end will give you a feeling that lasts a long time. A good feeling.

I finally looked at my dad's death certificate and discharge papers (DD214).
He was 16 when he entered the military but, you were suppose to be 18. So, he put his year of birth as 1924. It wasn't an issue until he applied for Social Security.

Looking at the DD214 it says "WOUNDS RECEIVED AS A RESULT OF ACTION WITH ENEMY FORCES (Place and date, if known)"

"Two (2)"

WTH? The military didn't know where? or were they so lazy someone didn't bother to enter it?

It would not offend me. Thank you for the compliment and I am so sorry that your dad is not doing well. I hope you are not put in the same predicament I was.

I can tell you that most of the patients that were dieing in ICU had no one. Not a single visitor. They died alone. I am sure they were scared. I know my dad was. It isn't like most people think. My dad was aware and concious, even though he was medicated so he wouldn't feel the pain. It wasn't like he was asleep and just drifted off.

I was always for Death with Dignity but, our state didn't pass the law. Oregon did and I wish my dad would have been able to make his own choice.

My dad's twin used to what they would say is "ride the rails" which means just hop on a train and go. Not a passenger train, a
cargo train. When my dad left the marines he did that with his brother but, decided that is not the life he wanted. So, he re-enlisted
in the military. His brother rode the rails till the day he died (that was my uncle Lester).

So, imagine my surprise when I had just got home from school and the phone rang and when I answered, it was the operator,
wanting to know if I would accept a collect call from my brother. I was about 15 and my brother was 16. My brother said something
like "oh, tell dad &amp; mom I am in CA. Me &amp; xxxxx hopped a train so I will be home in a few days". What a twit and I thought my parents
were going to kill him when he got back (not really kill, just a figure of speech).

My dad, with the help of my mom, taught all 5 of us to be kind, honest and not give up. That is what most parents try
to teach their kids though.

I remember when I was very little and my dad took me outside and showed me a big butterfly. It was huge (everthing is huge I think when you are young). I just remember how pretty it was and I wanted to pet it and he tried to explain to me why I couldn't. That even petting it could hurt it. So, I didn't pet it. Then he showed me a bee and I thought how pretty with the yellow and black colors. So, I thought I would be smart and not ask to pet it that way I could just do it. I did pet it and it was fuzzy. Then I picked it up and held it in my little enclosed hand and it stung me. I cried and got mad at my dad for not telling me it could bite (that is what I thought it did). I remember he laughed and said "I never said to PICK it up!!!!" <img src="http://cdn2.able2know.org/images/v5/emoticons/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing"/> <img src="http://cdn2.able2know.org/images/v5/emoticons/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing"/> <img src="http://cdn2.able2know.org/images/v5/emoticons/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing"/>

My mom always said that I was a "good" kid growing up. She never had to worry about anything I did or where I was. I always listened. She still says I have the coldest heart of anyone she has ever met though.

Hi TTH, memories like the bee story are priceless! I smiled when I read that, and can imagine you smiling as you typed it.

As for the cold heart comment, that surprises me. You seem very warm, sharing your fond memories of your Dad with us all. Perhaps you are more like your Dad than you know...bottling things up and not showing much emotion, and this has been misinterpreted as a "cold heart"? Just a thought...

The place where I grew up didn't have really anything to do. I always say and still do, that there was a post office, police station, a grocery store and a bowling alley. Not much for a bunch of kids. So, one day my brother, sister and myself were hanging out down by the store. I went inside and took a pack of gum. The manager grabbed me before I made it out the door. He knew I took it and he knew my family too. He tried to get me to say my brother put me up to it. I said NO, I did it. Then he said it had to be my sister and I said, NO, I did it. So, he gave up and said I had 1/2 hour to have my parents call him. I went outside and told my brother &amp; sister I had to go home and why. They said "you idiot", mom is going to kill you. I didn't want to go alone so my sister went with me. I tried to talk her into going in and telling my parents while I waited outside and she wouldn't. So, I went in and told them. My dad didn't say a word. My mom asked "why in the world did you take a pack of gum? I would understand an apple but, a pack of gum!!!!!!" I looked at my mom like this <img src="http://cdn2.able2know.org/images/v5/emoticons/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused"/> and said why would I take an apple? I don't like apples. End result = restriction &amp; no gum

I contacted the military and let them know how I felt about the service the honor guard provided. They emailed me back to get more info so
they can contact the specific people that were involved. I didn't mention anything about having to refold the flag. I told them they did a wonderful job.

I also sent off for the Presidential Memorial Certificate. Then I called mom and told her I did that. I wasn't sure my mom would want
one since she doesn't like our current President. She didn't say much.

So dad,
I just got off the phone with mom. She didn't cry. She said "call your sister". I said "call her what?". She did her usual "YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN!!". So, I asked her why am I suppose to call?

I rarely emailed my dad since my parents live real close to me but, I would have gone on his computer to show him this. This was emailed to me. I thought it was funny. This video reminded me of a cat I had. I told my dad the cat is hilarious. He would do just about everything and more than this cat in the video.

Today or yesterday was really hard for me. I always called my dad the day before I had to get on an airplane. He would listen patiently as I complained how scared I was and didn't want to go. He would tell me everything will be fine and to call him when I got to where I was flying.

When I was 19 and in the hospital for 3 months my dad would go to work during the day and then drive for an hour one way to see me in the hospital. He did that every day I was there.

People have called and emailed me and have told me that they are amazed at how well I am handling his death. What they don't know is I am not handling it well. I find myself waking up during the night in tears. I really miss him.

Thanks Noddy24
I am trying. I just really believed that I would die before my dad. That is what I always told him since I had so many surgeries and when my right lung started to rip away from my chest wall and the doctor's told me they won't operate until it pushes into the left lung. When that happens I will lose both lungs. So, it is just a matter of time for me. This came from the U of W medical center lung transplant doctors. It wasn't suppose to happen to begin with and they can't find anyone else that this has happened to.

What was so hard with my dad was holding his hand until he died. I never even considered I would ever have to do that. He was aware of what was going on since the staff turned down the pain meds so we could say good bye. It was in the middle of the night when he woke up scared that I told him when they took the life support off I wouldn't leave and I would hold his hand and not let go. I promised him I would not let him die alone. He nodded his head that he understood.

Well dad, I got through Thanksgiving. I will try and go to your grave site sometime this week. Mr. C died about a week ago. It was cancer too. He was only sick, that anyone knew of, for a short time. L has liver cancer and I hope he makes it. I know that is wishful thinking since that cancer has no cure. It is so unfair, he is only in his 40's with a wife and kids. Yeah, I know life is unfair but, it doesn't make the hurt go away.

This will be the first Christmas without my dad. A friend sent this poem to me. I would have showed it to my dad. I don't know who wrote the poem. I didn't alter it or add to it. I did "x" out the name, state and unit # of the person who apparently sent this out over the internet.

A Different Christmas Poem

The embers glowed softly, and in their dim light,
I gazed round the room and I cherished the sight.
My wife was asleep, her head on my chest,
My daughter beside me, angelic in rest.
Outside the snow fell, a blanket of white,
Transforming the yard to a winter delight.
The sparkling lights in the tree I believe,
Completed the magic that was Christmas Eve.
My eyelids were heavy, my breathing was deep,
Secure and surrounded by love I would sleep.
In perfect contentment, or so it would seem,
So I slumbered, perhaps I started to dream.

The sound wasn't loud, and it wasn't too near,
But I opened my eyes when it tickled my ear.
Perhaps just a cough, I didn't quite know, Then the
sure sound of footsteps outside in the snow.
My soul gave a tremble, I struggled to hear,
And I crept to the door just to see who was near.
Standing out in the cold and the dark of the night,
A lone figure stood, his face weary and tight.

A soldier, I puzzled, some twenty years old,
Perhaps a Marine, huddled here in the cold.
Alone in the dark, he looked up and smiled,
Standing watch over me, and my wife and my child.
"What are you doing?" I asked without fear,
"Come in this moment, it's freezing out here!
Put down your pack, brush the snow from your sleeve,
You should be at home on a cold Christmas Eve!"

For barely a moment I saw his eyes shift,
Away from the cold and the snow blown in drifts..
To the window that danced with a warm fire's light
Then he sighed and he said "Its really all right,
I'm out here by choice. I'm here every night."
"It's my duty to stand at the front of the line,
That separates you from the darkest of times.
No one had to ask or beg or implore me,
I'm proud to stand here like my fathers before me.
My Gramps died at ' Pearl on a day in December,"
Then he sighed, "That's a Christmas 'Gram always remembers."
My dad stood his watch in the jungles of ' Nam ',
And now it is my turn and so, here I am.
I've not seen my own son in more than a while,
But my wife sends me pictures, he's sure got her smile.

Then he bent and he carefully pulled from his bag,
The red, white, and blue... an American flag.
I can live through the cold and the being alone,
Away from my family, my house and my home.
I can stand at my post through the rain and the sleet,
I can sleep in a foxhole with little to eat.
I can carry the weight of killing another,
Or lay down my life with my sister and brother..
Who stand at the front against any and all,
To ensure for all time that this flag will not fall."
"So go back inside," he said, "harbor no fright,
Your family is waiting and I'll be all right."
"But isn't there something I can do, at the least,
"Give you money," I asked, "or prepare you a feast?
It seems all too little for all that you've done,
For being away from your wife and your son."
Then his eye welled a tear that held no regret,

"Just tell us you love us, and never forget.
To fight for our rights back at home while we're gone,
To stand your own watch, no matter how long.
For when we come home, either standing or dead,
To know you remember we fought and we bled.
Is payment enough, and with that we will trust,
That we mattered to you as you mattered to us."

Christmas will be coming soon and some credit is due to our U.S.service
men and women for our being able to celebrate these festivities. Let's try in this small way to pay a tiny bit of what we owe. Make people stop and think of our heroes, living and dead, who sacrificed themselves for us.

We're coming up on the first anniversary of the death of both our fathers, TTH.

It has only been in the last couple of months that I've been able to have the slightest thought about my dad without crying. I think I'm finally ready to open the last box of his mementos that I had packed up and shipped to myself. It's been sitting in a closet while I've been unable to deal with the contents. It's a very slow healing process, but I've gotten to know a lot about my dad that I didn't know before.

The good news is that it will soon not be an occasion for yet another painful "first" without him. I'm told it will now be considerably easier. I'm planning to spend that day going through the big box of his things, preparing them for distribution to relatives, and get it behind me.

I hope things are getting a little easier for you too. Do you have any plans you'd like to share?

Looking out the left side of the door....

My dad would have enjoyed these, especially the cat watching. The cat doesn't chase them anymore. He knows I won't feed him if he does. Same with birds. He killed a baby bird one time and I kept that bird for a few days and would show it to him, show him the food and say NO. I did that every day for 3 days without feeding him. Since then, he has not killed a bird in my yard.

Thanks OCCUM BILL. Some times a virtual hug is better than no hug at all.

This is when I miss my dad the most. I have to get on a plane in a few hours and I am scared. Don't know why, I just am. I am so tired of people telling me "you will be fine" or "you fly more than most people, what the hell do you have to be scared of". Oh well, some things never change.

I will be thinking of you dad.

Hey there TTH. Glad your flight was a safe one.

I won't board my dog at a kennel, either. Though I'm sure that there really are some good ones.

Here's some pics of where I take my dog to. It's an actual doggie hotel. I know that sounds funny but they give them a lot on 1 on 1 care. You can leave your animal there if you are going out of town or if you just need day care for them. They also groom my dog for me when it needs done. (for an extra fee)

This is the front entrance.

<img src="http://i301.photobucket.com/albums/nn50/brookesphotos27/officewelcome.jpg" alt="http://i301.photobucket.com/albums/nn50/brookesphotos27/officewelcome.jpg"/>

You go through this one set of double doors and it takes you back to the rooms. They each have their own room with a bed, radio, and whatever toys you wish to bring from home.

<img src="http://i301.photobucket.com/albums/nn50/brookesphotos27/petrooms.jpg" alt="http://i301.photobucket.com/albums/nn50/brookesphotos27/petrooms.jpg"/>

Here's one of the play rooms where the animals can play together. Always supervised of course.

<img src="http://i301.photobucket.com/albums/nn50/brookesphotos27/playyardfun.jpg" alt="http://i301.photobucket.com/albums/nn50/brookesphotos27/playyardfun.jpg"/>

They have toy boxes scattered around and the animals get into them and take what they want. Just like a kid! <img src="http://cdn2.able2know.org/images/v5/emoticons/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing"/>

<img src="http://i301.photobucket.com/albums/nn50/brookesphotos27/Toysbox.jpg" alt="http://i301.photobucket.com/albums/nn50/brookesphotos27/Toysbox.jpg"/>

They have a huge fenced in area outside for them to get fresh air. Although if you want your dog exercised for say, a nice long hike....that's an extra charge.

Anyhow......it's the only way I can leave my dog and feel half-way ok about it. Though there are never any guarantees.

God help me when I have kids and start needing babysitters. <img src="http://cdn2.able2know.org/images/v5/emoticons/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing"/>

Dad
The surgery was done on my shoulder and it appears to be successful. I am working real hard on the physical therapy.

Something happened a few days after the operation and I was rushed to ICU at TGH. At first I didn't know what was going on because I didn't feel real sick. The doctors told me they didn't know what was wrong, they had a lot of questions, but no answers.

As time went on and seeing the monitors I realized things were not good. When it got to the point where I had to wear a full face oxygen mask because I could no longer breath on my own is when the doctors came in and this one special doctor held my hands, looked me in the eyes and as he teared up told
me time was running out and they were afraid I wasn't going to make it. I felt real bad for the doctors because they were working so hard trying to figure out why my body was shutting down and they didn't know. I could see how frustrated they were.

So, who would have thought that the same week you died and the day you were buried, I was in ICU facing similar circumstances as you. I wrote this because when I was told I probably wouldn't make it I felt a sense of comfort in dealing with your death. I wasn't in any pain and my mind never gave up hope. I sense you felt the same way except for your body gave up, but you never did and that helped me accept your death.

@cyphercat,

Thank you cyphercat and Roberta. Something is still wrong, the doctors can see it in the x-rays of my lungs. They just don't know what it is. I feel okay and I go back and get x-rays in a few days.

What is even more strange is my mom was admitted into a different hospital the very same week and was put into ICU also. So both me and my mom were in ICU wards the same week my dad was a year ago. My mom is home now so I am spending a lot of time there helping her out.

I didn't let my mom, brothers or sisters know that I was in the hospital. I thought it was best for them to visit with mom and help her get well. My brothers and sisters were finally called when the doctors didn't think I was going to make it. They weren't so understanding. I know my dad would have understood why I didn't tell them.

I didn't want to post anything about my medical situation until I found out more information from the doctors. I will try to keep this short.

I had non-invasive surgery for frozen shoulder. Low risk, but the anesthesiologist called me at home prior to the surgery date and said he wasn't comfortable having the surgery done in the orthopedic surgery clinic. Based on my medical history, he wanted the surgery done in the hospital. Learned something new since I thought the surgeon decided where.

They did the surgery on a Thursday and then on Friday I went to physical therapy. Over the weekend I started to feel like I had the flu. My temp. was 103º.
I just put cold wash cloths on my face and kept on my feet so I would not get pneumonia. Monday my temp was down to 100º and I still felt kinda fluish, not really bad. So, I went to physical therapy Mon., Tues. and Wed. and on Wed. also had a post op appt. with the surgeon. She looked at me and asked how I felt and I told her what I wrote above. She went and got her stethescope (sp?) and listened to my lungs and then went into another room. She came back and said she had called the imaging clinic and my family doc. I was to go get x-rays and go straight to my doc. I asked why and she said "because I said so".
Went and got the x-rays and then went to my doctors'. They did my vitals and my doc said I needed to get to the ER. I asked why and he wasn't volunteering any info. except to say I had pneumonia in my right lung (which I already knew since I read the x-ray report on the way to his office). My oxygen level was 85.

By the time I got to the ER they were ready for me and were taking my vitals and the doctor had a <img src="http://cdn2.able2know.org/images/v5/emoticons/icon_confused.gif" alt="Confused"/> &lt; look on his face. I asked what is going on? The were trying different blood pressure machines and oximeter readers. They brought the chest x-ray machine into the room and took some x-rays. Still the doc isn't telling me what is going on. I was looking at my other 1/2 with a look of concern. Then they put me on a automatic blood pressure machine that takes your blood pressure every so many minutes. It started setting off the alarms and when I saw the #'s I thought wth??? My blood pressure was dropping dramatically. Then the nurse came in the room to do a blood gas. So, I asked her what my oxygen level was and she said the doc would have to tell me. A blood gas is where they take blood from your artery to verify your oxygen level. Still the blood pressure machine alarms are going off during this and my blood pressure was still dropping. I told the nurse I was relaxed as possible and try not to miss that artery because it hurts like hell when they do. She got it the first time <img src="http://cdn2.able2know.org/images/v5/emoticons/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy"/>

Within 10 minutes they had the results and the doc said the pneumonia was already spreading to my left lung and my oxygen level was in the 70's. He asked me if I was dizzy. I starting laughing and said if you ask most people they would say yes. He said this isn't funny so, I said no I am not dizzy and why am I still alert and talking if my blood pressure is so low and my oxygen level is so low. He said he had no idea and I was going over to ICU asap.

From there things just went down and was continuing to go down. They had a lot of doctors working hard to try to save my life. The problem was they didn't know what was causing all this. I never lost my sense of humor though.

I might write more later and if anyone can learn anything from my experience that is good enough for me.

After I was in ICU and hooked up, my other 1/2 looked at his watch and I looked at the clock. Finally I just said go to work. No sense in you sitting around this hospital doing nothing. Also in the morning go to work. The hospital will call you if anything changes. Just come by when you have time.

I called one of my best friends, that would be Bill, and told him I was in the hospital. Next thing I know he shows up. He took the entire time off of work and stayed with me in the hospital 24/7 except for going home to shower and eat and there was 1 night he didn't stay.

My other 1/2 had never met Bill so they finally got to met. The hospital staff was confused at first thinking Bill was my spouse and I had to correct them and say no, the other one is my spouse.

One of the things I did and some people don't know you can do this is when I would get the menu for breakfast, lunch or dinner and I didn't like the choices listed, I just made my own list. As long as you are not on a special diet, you can write in what it is you want to eat and the hospital does its best to accomodate you within reason.

One menu had salmon or ham as the choice for dinner. I don't like either so I wrote in cheeseburger, barbeque chips, chocolate pudding, diet coke, fruit cup and a banana. I would also circle things that were listed just in case they didn't or couldn't provide what I wrote down. I guess they couldn't find a small bag of chips because they sent up a whole big bag of barbeque chips.

I am so glad I spent every night in ICU with my dad. He would wake up scared and I would jump up and immediately reassure him that I was there and he was okay.

The 1 night Bill didn't stay in ICU with me is the only night I woke up scared. I was disoriented and I felt like I was in a horror movie. I kept thinking masquerade party because I had this full face oxygen mask on and I didn't have that on me when I fell asleep. The room was barely lit and I could see shadows, a broom, a hook from the ceiling and a closet door. I thought I saw the closet door open and there were a set of eyes looking at me.

That is when I freaked out. I tore that mask off my face and looked at it, screamed and tossed it. I tore the 5 leads away from my chest and jumped out of bed and was stretching the iv tubing trying to get to that closet to see what was in there.

The machine alarms were going off and a young nurse came running and asked "is something wrong" to which I said - Yes, something is really wrong, go get out while you can. The look on her face was priceless and she said "I'm new here". I told her she better go then while there is still time. She went running down the hall and she came back with another nurse. By this time I was awake and coherent. I told that young nurse apparently the hospital never told her that this was the psycho ICU unit <img src="http://cdn2.able2know.org/images/v5/emoticons/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing"/>

Another good thing to know is that the hospital only keeps your x-rays, cat scans and mri for 10 years, then they destroy them. I don't know if this applies to all states or not. The doctor's offices keep those items indefinitely. I only found this out when I went to get the x-rays and cat scans that were taken when I was hospitalized for my right lung surgery. I was shocked and pissed because I wanted and needed those for a baseline for the doctors to go by. Now I go and get those items from the hospital and keep them at my house.

I received the hospital bill today. The total pre-negotiated rate was $60,169.62
The billing dept. employee even came up to ICU as I was being hooked up to the machines with that stupid credit card sliding machine and wanted me to pay my co-pay. I guess they wanted to make sure they got something in case I died. That is pathetic imo.

My dad wanted all 5 of us kids to get along. We are so different though. The other night all 5 of us were at my parents house when my sister and I got into it. I was trying to tell my oldest sister something and my other sister keep interrupting. I asked her to stop, but she wouldn't. I only had 2 sentences I wanted to say to my oldest sister. I couldn't even do that because of my other sister. Finally I just told her she was a bitch. My mom shook her head and my oldest sister stood there with her mouth open. Then my other sister said "f*uck you, I am leaving" to which I replied "good, go, because you are a bitch anyway".

She went out the door to her car and then I remembered I needed to find out what time she was going to show up in the morning. So, I followed her out and asked her, she asked me what time I needed her to show up. My oldest sister had a stunned look to her face. She said she thought I was mad at the other sister and I said "I am, what does that have to do with finding out what time she will be here in the morning?". My other sister and I decided on a time and my oldest sister said we were weird. I said no we aren't since that is the way we are and it isn't anything new.

Back to when I was in ICU....after the doctor said he didn't think I would live, I looked at my other 1/2, who wouldn't look at me. I looked at Bill and he was looking at my other 1/2. Finally Bill said X (my other 1/2's name) did you just comprehend what the doctors said, they think TTH is going to die? My other 1/2 is still not looking at me and nodded his head yes. I looked at Bill and he looked at me and said I have to go and I will be back.

My other 1/2 finally looked at me and got up, took me by the shoulders and started shaking me, saying don't you die on me, hear me don't die. I remember thinking okay he is losing it.

Bill came back and my other 1/2 was mumbling about how he didn't know where the will was and he was going to plan something special for our anniversary. That pissed me off so, I ripped that oxygen mask off and started screaming at him to pull himself together. I said where do you think I would file the will? Lets see, hmm maybe under W!!!! and if you want to plan something special, plan a f*cking funeral. By then the nurses were there because the alarm was going off (oxygen mask) and they were hooking me back up.

After getting out of the hospital I felt bad for saying that to him. I went to apologize and he said he didn't know what I was talking about. I called Bill because he was in the room at the time and asked him what exactly did I yell at my other 1/2. Bill confirmed what I wrote above and I told Bill my other 1/2 said I never said anything like that. Bill set me straight that my other 1/2 wasn't dealing with the news very well.

Oh and my oldest brother came in the room, took me by the shoulders kinda shaking me and loudly was saying you are not going to die, hear me, you are not going to die. Geez, I though for sure these guys were losing it.

Just in case anyone is reading this or even cares, the drugs that were going into my IV were:
Saline
Potassium
Steroids
Antibiodics

There was a total of 196 lab tests performed from the blood draws that were taken. The tests were to find a bacteria or virus that was possibly the cause of the problem. That sounds kinda weird since the doctors didn't know what the problem was.

So, the $ amounts for that ICU stay was all of them. Then it happened again. It = my oxygen level dropped to 79%, heart rate 42 &amp; blood pressure 67/33. That was in October. I am just now starting to get the insurance statements. The doctors still don't know why this is happening. I will post the cost of that stay when I get all the bills.

Finally I got the hospital bill. It is $16,996.45

It was less than the last bill because the doctors didn't have to re-do all the labs or procedures they did the first time. Like sticking tubes up my nose and down my throat into my lungs or putting a scope down my throat to look at my heart. You know, the fun stuff.

I made the heart surgeon mad. The drugs to make me relax don't work on me so we did it without. He had that scope down my throat and I asked him how long he was going to be because it was very uncomfortable. He sternly told me NOT to talk because when I did, the scope moved and it was right by my heart. So, I started giggling instead. He was not happy.

TTH,

I am sitting here with tears streaming down my face. What a bautiful tribute you have given your father in this thread. I do hope and pray that you continue to do so. The love you two obviously had for each other is an inspiration.

The pictures are beautiful. I hesitated to post that, because saying funeral pictures are beautiful does not sound right, but the beauty comes from you and the love you had for your father, if that makes sense to you.

I will keep you and your family in my prayers. God bless you and keep you. This is a beautiful thread..................absolutely beautiful.

I am so glad that you are recovering. You have definitely been through the wringer. I admire your strength.

You are quite a beautiful woman and that is an adorable puppy!

@Arella Mae,

Arella Mae,
The reason I wasn't going to post here anymore is because I have fully accepted my dad's death. Being able to write about my dad helped me get through some tough times. What really helped me accept his death was being in ICU and being told by the docs their best estimate is I only had about 12 hours left. I wasn't in pain and I wasn't scared. So, if I felt that way maybe my dad felt the same way. That gave me comfort.

I thought about 3 things mainly.

1) Letting the doctors know I was okay and I knew they did their best to help me. I hugged them and thanked them.
2) I made my other 1/2 promise me to let certain people on this site know what happened. He didn't want to and I finally told him I would haunt him if he didn't <img src="http://cdn2.able2know.org/images/v5/emoticons/icon_lol.gif" alt="Laughing"/>
3) I just wanted to hold my dog one last time. The nurses told me they would let me know when they felt the time was getting close so I could have someone bring my dog in. Was that against the rules? Yes. They were kind enough to make an exception knowing how much it meant to me.

Anyway, I wanted to let you know I read what you posted. Strong? I wasn't strong after my dad died. I was actually a mess and it is still really hard to go to my parents house. My mom is so sad and I don't know what to do to help her.

Oh Dad,
I wish so much you were here. Never in my life would I think I would pet a real alligator in the wild. This gator was big and I was really careful to watch where it's head was because I kinda like having a hand/arm. I did this while on a tour boat in New Orleans and when this huge thing came up along side the boat I just reached over in the water and petted it.

This won't make sense to anyone, but I finally found the company as far as it's actual location and it is in the United States which makes what they are doing a federal offense. I can't stand these companies who rip people off.

Dad,
I am so glad you are not here to have to hear about the shootings or about Doris' cancers. I have attended the memorials, been with my sister throughout her appt., procedures and surgeries and done my best to stop by mom's. I didn't tell my sister what the surgeon said to me on the last surgery. In fact I haven't told anyone. I think she will heal better without the stress of knowing and I'm not sure I am doing the right thing by not telling her. I feel I am and that is all I can go by.

I am going away again.....don't really want to so I listen to this:

Yep I am still here talking to my dad. I took a picture of the hawk that the ship tried to take out to sea. Picked up the phone and called the reception desk and asked them not to take this stow away out to sea because I didn't know how far it could fly. I told them it was on the starboard side, under the bridge and hiding from the camera. The woman started laughing and told me she would let the bridge officers know.

I am doing okay. Still can't bring myself to go to the cemetery though. Time helps, like it always does, in accepting that he is gone. I will forever miss him. I couldn't have asked for a better dad.

People think because I am the youngest of the 5 that I was spoiled by my parents. My parents didn't spoil me at all. I had to get a job if I wanted to buy things. My parents were strict but fair. My sister is still having a real hard time accepting his death. She was his favorite and I wish there was something I could do to help her not hurt so much.

@Arella Mae,

I am doing okay and have accepted my dad's death. He lived a good long life and he was able to see his grandkids and great grandkids.
Thank you for asking <img src="http://cdn2.able2know.org/images/v5/emoticons/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile"/>

Right now though my sister is going through a really hard time. She has had 3 separate aggressive life threatening cancers in less than 11 months.

Two of them have already been dealt with surgically and she is cancer free in those organs. Now she has a 3rd cancer and has to have surgery soon.
I am glad my dad is not here to see or know what she is going through because she was his favorite, which never bothered me btw. She is still having a hard time dealing with my dad's death. I have talked to her about it and I think gradually she will come to terms with all of it.

I did find a veterans memorial museum in the state I live in where their goal is to honor and never forget our veterans. Since my dad gave me his WWII helmet and my mom still has all his medals and the sword he brought back from a Japanese soldier, I am going to look into donating or loaning them those items. She also has an article that was in the newspaper back during the war that talked about the battle my dad fought in and was shot.

My mom's intention is to give my brother the medals and sword so I spoke to my brother about this museum because I knew if he agreed with my idea, he could talk to my mom and get her to agree to have my dad's items in the museum. He liked the idea and I am going to provide him info. on this museum and I will talk to the people at the museum. I know my dad would like that his items from the war be in a museum for others to see and learn.

I don't think my mom would want me to write on the internet some of the things she told me about the war. So, it will have to wait. To me it is history and it is interesting because it dealt with Germany, Russia &amp; the United States.

My sister did well during her 3rd surgery. The part that sucks is she has cancer again. This is the 4th cancer now. My mom doesn't know that my sister has cancer again.

My sister asked me if she was going to die from the cancer. It's hard sometimes to find the right thing to say. Since I have been taking her to appts. and procedures, I am learning more about cancer than I ever cared to learn.

I can't imagine life without my sister. It saddens me to see her go through so much. Hopefully this cancer can be stopped. At times like these, I am glad my dad isn't here to know what is happening.

Dad this weekend was really tough on me because I went through your personal belongings as well as mom's. I wrote everything down (inventoried it all) and took pics. We packed it all up and put it all in storage.

The history I wrote about earlier, my mom being German, met Hitler. My mom unknowingly had ties to Russia. What a mess considering my dad was in the Army. That meant Germany, Russia and the United States all got involved. Looking back I can laugh, yet it wasn't funny at the time if you can imagine 3 govts. in times of war and peace.

@Roberta,

Thank you Roberta and others who read, yet say nothing.

My dad taught us not to give up and sometimes that is exactly what I want to do. I want to run away and not come back ever. Then reality sets in and I know that is not the answer. I can't or will not run away from reality or any problem that I feel is worth fighting for.

My sister is worth fighting for, even if I don't know what to fight against. That is what angers me. The doctors, who I highly respect, can't find the source and the technology of the machines can't either. It is so frustrating because I do my best under pressure when there is a solution. I am not finding a solution at this time.

That's impossible to answer informatively without asking a million questions.

The short answer though is that your mother doesn't know how to handle her frustrations well.

<post author="PUNKEY" datetime="2012-02-14T07:10:00" id="p3">
How about just asking her "Mom, is there anything I can do to help out?"

Maybe feeding the baby was the LAST thing she needed done. Cleaning, cookiing, etc. might be what she needed then.

But ask first.

She seems overloaded and stressed out.

<post author="CoastalRat" datetime="2012-02-14T07:22:00" id="p4">
@charrymuffin,

Maybe you are over reacting just a tad? You wrote that your mom responded in a mean tone. How does that equate to yelling at you? Then you write that you went to your sister and said "give me her thing," or something similar. From where I sit, you treated your sister exactly how you claim your mom treated you. So maybe you need to start by apologizing to your sister.

Assuming your mom did respond in a mean tone toward you, remember that she may well be frustrated. You have no idea how she was feeling or what may have been on her mind. So she replied to you in a mean tone. Big deal. Get over it.

Your mom had not yelled at you, she might got confuse about the baby's feed. So she told you that your elder sister had tried this before. Or might your mother is facing some problem and she might be tensed about it. That's why she yelled at you.

<quote orig_author="Abracamon">

</quote>

No. Sex doesn't just happen by accident. You did mean for it to happen. You need to own up to your part in this. Since I have no information, I am going to assume that you are (a) under the age of 18 and (b) female. Wrong? Right? Impossible to tell from the information given.

But either way, hell, I'll just go ahead.

Like I mentioned above, sex is a deliberate act. If there's at least one guy involved, an erection has to happen. It has to be put somewhere. These things don't happen by accident. It doesn't just suddenly fall in from the sky, magically sweeping away clothes, objections, etc.

You're darn tootin' that feelings are confusing. But they are with any type of sex if you are not ready for it.

I am often inclined, with topics like this, to declare it a fake topic. And perhaps others will say that, and maybe it is. So instead of an incest topic, I am going to answer it as a teenaged sex topic.

People have hormones. Hormones often pull us around and push us into actions that, if we were not so influenced, we would not do, or at least we would think twice about. I am not saying that the mind or desire are not to blame - but if you are a teen (and I am going to lay bets that you are), then you are in hormone overload. You met up with the first possible sex partner you could have (and, perhaps, so did he), and so hormones took control and there you are.

Hormones may be there but we need not let them take charge of us. And one way to do that is by getting out of situations where it's easy to allow ourselves to be swept away. As in, don't get into situations where you are the only ones at home, and no one is expected for hours. How do you do that? Sheesh, there are a million ways. Go to a girlfriend's house. Study in the library. Get a part-time after-school job. Take up running. Whatever. This won't happen again if you and he are not in the same town unless other people are around, yes?

What else? Recognize that you have a part in this, and own up to it. I am assuming (there is so little in your post) that this was mutually consensual. He did not attack and rape you, right? Then you need to admit that you were a part of this. And you need to understand why you were a part of it. I doubt it's specific desire so much as it was hormones/opportunity. So eliminate the opportunities and refocus your energies elsewhere. All teenagers are pretty hormonally-driven, but the vast majority of them don't satisfy their urges with family members. So go out there - there are other fellows out there, you know. They are not necessarily viable sex partners for you, but they are probably viable boyfriends for you.

I suspect you are both lonely kids who didn't think there would be anyone else. Well, you're both wrong. There are other people out there. Go and get those other people - the confusing feelings you are having are, most likely, due to sex, where you think you need to feel something when, I suspect, you didn't initially. Otherwise, I doubt you'd be framing it as something that just "happened".

How is it that you spent so much time together - resulting in a very intimate act with him?

Something's not right here. If you knew he was your brother, and he knew you were his sister, how did this get into a sexual thing? Usually, the "ick" brakes would be applied just about now. It seems like there were no healthy boundaries between you two.

Don't confuse this as "love" for him.

First off, thanks Andy.

And thanks to you, Abracamon, for coming back. Obviously, being raised apart means that some of the ick brakes are kinda short-circuited. After all, up until you knew you had a brother, he could've just been some guy you saw on the street.

But - you have been raised together or at least aware of each other for two years. The ick brakes had time to regrow since then, I am thinking.

You're not bad people. You're teenaged people.

<post author="fresco" datetime="2012-01-09T00:59:00" id="p10">
@Abracamon,

Your separation explains quite a lot. Siblings reared together tend to develop biological scent awareness which seems to discourage sexual attraction. Later re-establishment of contact with "someone like you" has emotional impact without that biological defense mechanism

In my opinion, you are more of a "victim" of the situation than a "cause", but this does not help you deal with the social consequences.

It's a well documented phenomenon, that siblings who are separated as children are usually quite disturbed by being sexually attracted when they're reunited. The BBC once did a drama about it, although in this case the siblings were adults. In the drama they do both go to court and the judge states the main problem is eugenics, that children born from such a union are far more likely to develop genetic abnormalities.

It's not something to encourage, not only will the poster's family be horrified by what's happened, but if it's known locally the couple are likely to suffer all manner of harassment. All I can advise is seek some counselling.

<post author="fullmarriageequality" datetime="2012-01-10T06:52:00" id="p18">
@Abracamon,

From everything you've said, it sounds like you are experiencing Genetic Sexual Attraction. Look it up. It is very common in close biological relatives who were separated while one of them was still under seven years of age, or had never met before, but are now pubescent or post-pubescent. Also, sexual exploration is more common than most people admit between siblings (full, half, step, or adopted) close in age.

Your feelings and attraction are entirely normal. Those who say otherwise are either ignorant or prejudiced. I strongly advise you to research "consanguinamory" and also "Genetic Sexual Attraction."

@Abracamon,

This is a serious stuff. I have read all opinions.
I am pretty sure that you love your brother more than normal and I agree with jes that hormones had very much to do in this case. Twins are identical, I mean, if you felt turned on by your brother undoubtedly he felt the same.
I want to think your sexual intercourse was solemn. Take care not to get impregnated. May be in the future both of you will take separated ways and this could be only one secret of kids that went beyond the border.
My best greetings for you

Have you ever had a jealous parent?
</headline>
<post author="Leah5454" datetime="2011-11-27T09:28:00" id="p1">
I am a family oriented person. I also am loyal. When my parents divorced at age 17, it made me take a closer look at how to know if one is married to the right personWhen I got engaged at age 26, my mother became very jealous. Now, it is three years later and she is still trying to get revenge on me. I suspect she is being told incorrect ideas from family or even her psychologist. By the way, I had to get married in city hall without her or my dad there and am happily married three years.
In the beginning of November, she called me, had visited her neice on a trip, came back, I asked for some gas money, she screamed at me stating whatever myself and my husband need, it is our fault, we deserve bad life etc. She told me she didnt care about us. She then mailed me a gift card she received from a friend she said she didnt like. So we made do with our situation and disconnected our cell phone as we were tight with money temporarily, no contract cell.
We had a nice Thanksgiving, had a simple meal at home. In the evening this so called mom left me a message, asking me if I had a meal to eat. I have no idea if she is like this from her medications. She seems to not be able to decide on anything so we suspect she is a schitzo. We dont know. We had asked her not to call here or not to write if she really believes she doesnt care. Now, I got a phone call from a "friend" of hers, who says your mother was worried about you. I didnt answer. I am struggling because it seems all she does is spread lies to people. I accept I no longer have a mother, but now, it has turned into harassmment. I find it hard to go on as I normally would when I have to consider taking time to get a new phone number, get a new email, the person will not leave me alone at all. And my husband who is very smart and good with people said all she wants to do is start trouble, bring people down. I am concerned I will eventually have to change my name or go to great lenths to hide. We are all entitled to our freedoms and I am feeling unsure of my own.

@Leah5454,

My deepest sympathies on such a predicament. IMHO, there's not a lot more you can do other than what you ARE already doing. It really sounds like you are doing the right things.

You're far better off letting a bit of time go by before you initiating any contact. She seems quite toxic in her behavior, whatever her diagnosis is or was. She is horribly hurtful and not healthy. You need to protect yourself and your loved ones from contact with her. You might consider instructing any of her 'friends' not to call you either.

<post author="FOUND SOUL" datetime="2011-11-27T14:41:00" id="p3">
@Leah5454,

It sounds as if you and your husband have a lot of love. Could it be that she is jealous of that connection rather than you personally...

It's horrible for a child to be put down by a parent, no one deserves a bad life.

I always think when someone says something hurtful, it is because they are hurt. To the back that up by sending a gift, "claiming they don't like it" is an apology.

Same with the concern if you had food for Thanksgiving and having a friend then call as well.

You don't say anything about your Dad, only that they both were not at your wedding.

We can not choose our parents, but often we don't see what they went through in their life which may reflect their actions. She may be jealous of not being loved like you are, by your husband.

Sometimes the best way to ease pain is to find out the truth, then make your decisions... Maybe she is nuts and that's the reason, if so, then you can acknowledge that and move on. But, maybe it's that she never felt loved and in her state, sometimes lets the hurt out, if that was the case, maybe you could find some good things that she did for you as a child, remember those and see if you could bring it in you to bond again with her.

Only you really know that.

What you don't mention, is whether your mother's behavior has always been erratic, or this type of behavior is something new.
People don't generally change drastically, what that something is wrong. You mentioned her medications, could this warrant further investigation?
If you are so ready to cut her out of your life, there must be something here that you're not telling us. Why would you need to hide from her, are you not able to set boundaries?

Your mother sounds like she has MANY issues going on - and you are just one of them. I don't know if she is jealous of you, but for sure, she has a tough time interacting with you, as an adult.

Try to distance yourself from her and go on with your life.

Life is short. Concentrate on improving yourself.

I know it hurts to have a parent act so bizaare. But she is sick.

Moving out of the nest is a rite of passage, a sign one has reached adulthood.

But for a variety of reasons the number of adult Americans still living with their parents has grown in recent years.

For some a job disappears, or even fails to materialise, despite a pricey university education. For others a "temporary" move back home to save money becomes more or less permanent.

In 2011, 19% of men aged 25 to 34 shacked up with mom and dad, up from 14% in 2005, according to figures released by the US Census bureau. For women the number is 10%, up from 8%

I can't answer for America, although the past 4 years I have been in communication with 100's of American women, mostly pregnant at 21, or younger, working in a hardware store, or wallmart or the likes... Rare in all that time have I heard of "power jobs."...One close dear friend works on Contract gets paid monthly and then some, has to pay for tools and goods to do the work first, is almost bankrupt and hangs doors, pulls up carpet, tiles, herself...

Here in Australia it's quite equal... Both work in any career, yes women can make more or equal, or less... Less children and more career orientated couples for the most part to at least 26 - 28...

And here, stay at home Dads are common.....

I personally think it's sad at the lack of work for either sex over there and the hard reality and struggles by alot.

You are obsessed with gender. More people staying at home has a hell of a lot more to do with the economic climate than gender roles.

It's more expensive to move out. You generally need a job. That you don't connect the dots (especially when the article talks about it right before the quote you mined) and jump to your gender obsession is quite telling. This isn't "proof" that young men are in "big trouble" it's just a predictable consequence of the economy that you are insisting on viewing through the lens of a troglodyte.

I see that you missed that the problem is twice as bad for men as it is for women, and that it is getting worse faster for men than for women.

FAIL.

EDIT: this much difference can on lead to the conclusion that men are not successfully competing with women. We need to know why, why are men losing so badly, an what do we intend to do about it? Special programs for young men in high school sounds like a prudent step, so that we can get them ready for college. Right now if college admissions were to go back to being done on merit almost 60% of the freshman class would be women, we need to even the playing field.

@hawkeye10,

No, I didn't. It simply does not constitute "proof" of your sociological conclusions (go ahead and try to argue your case if you would like). And saying "FAIL" doesn't make your claims about the genration and gender roles true either, it just makes you sound like a thirteen-year old.

Nonsense. Here's just one theory off the top of my head: more women leave the home without jobs (through marriage) than men do and are more likely to have their moving out rates impacted by job availability.

It's really silly to argue by stating that no other conclusion is possible.

We need to know why, why are men losing so badly, an what do we intend to do about it?
</quote>

You are begging the question here. You are the one saying men are "losing", you haven't made a great case for staying at home being "losing". In fact this is a cultural artifact as in most places it is considered very odd to leave home as early as Americans tend to and this isn't viewed as being a "loser." In most places people stay until they get married, and there is a correlation between this trend and economic mobility.

@Robert Gentel,

<quote>
As colleges nationwide review freshman applications over the next several weeks, many will face lopsided numbers of male and female candidates. Some colleges maintain a gender balance, but national data in recent years show a 57%-43% split favoring women, both in enrollments and graduation rates. Richard Whitmire, author of Why Boys Fail and a former USA TODAY editorial writer, talks to reporter Mary Beth Marklein about how we got there, why we should care, and what should be done about it.

Q: Why do boys fail, and how do we turn that around?

A: The reforms launched by the nation's governors more than 20 years ago to get more students college-ready had an unintended consequence: Most girls adjusted nicely to the intensified verbal skills demanded in the early grades; most boys didn't. We have to figure out a way to keep boys on track with reading and writing skills. Boys are failing because the world has gotten more verbal and they haven't.

Q: The U.S. Commission on Civil Rights is investigating whethercolleges discriminate against girlsby giving boys a break in admissions, but you support affirmative action for male students for "just a little longer." How long is that?

A: I would like to get (college graduation rates) at a 55-45 split. We need to wait until corrections are made in elementary and high school that put boys on a better path toward college readiness. Improving verbal skills would be 90% of that task. The first measurement of success would be a drop in the number of boys in the ninth-grade "bulge" — the boys held back for another year because they are not prepared to start high school.

Q: Some data suggest minority and low-income boys are struggling the most. Are white boys from middle- or upper-income families not in crisis?

A: You can't look at the "affirmative action" in admissions for white males practiced at some elite private colleges and conclude there's no problem among middle-class white males. Black and Latino boys have the flu; white middle-class boys have a mild cold.

Q: There are economic consequences for men who don't pursue college, but you cite social implications as well.

A: The most striking was at James Madison University (where the ratio was about 60% female, 40% male). Some women there (said) it was not uncommon to see these parties where girls would get into this bizarre competition to win a guy who maybe even wasn't worth winning. And these guys were total players. The minority sex sets the rules, animal house rules, and these women would do very demeaning things just for the competition. They'd be embarrassed about that (but) they'd do it anyway. I'm really glad my daughters went to colleges where the genders were evenly balanced. But if I had a son, I wouldn't want him to develop these warped relationships, either.

The marriageable-mate dilemma, whether white women decide to "marry down" to less-educated males, will be a long-term impact of these gender gaps, and probably the biggest impact. Black women have long faced the marriageable-mate dilemma, and college-educated black women have low marriage rates and high out-of-wedlock birth rates. The question is whether more white women will start making similar choices.

Q: Do you worry, as some argue, that gains made by women come at the expense of men?

A: I do not think the gains of girls have come at the expense of boys. And interventions aimed at boys will not hurt girls — contrary to the fears of feminist groups.

Q: You want the U.S. Education Department to take action. How?

A: Many other countries have the same problems. The Education Department should do what the Australians did more than seven years ago, which was launch a national investigation into why boys are losing interest in school. Next, it needs to correct the mistake made in 2006, which was authorizing single-sex public schools but not offering school districts research on how to do it. Australia has not solved the problem, but at least they've created an intelligence pathway for schools interested in working on the gender gaps.

Q: How can a parent of a boy help him, here and now?

A: Don't believe your teacher when they say boys start out slowly but will catch up. That used to be true, but it's not now. Parents need to have a more liberal attitude about literacy. If your young son likes "goofy" books such as Captain Underpants, that's OK. Just keep him reading. The largest gender gaps are found in writing skills. Schools may overlook that — part of the 'boys will be boys' attitude — which means parents have to compensate. Writing matters.

Men failing to reach the life milestone of enough independence to be able to move out of their parents house at nearly twice the rate of women is falling behind just as surely as does the person who got a B on their exam when the person next to them got a A. It does not matter why the B was earned, or why a man could not move out of the house, the lower score is proof of the lack of competitiveness. The only way you can get out of that conclusion is if you can argue that men want to be living in their parents house, in which case you rightfully should destroy your credibility.

Oh, I see...according to you a subject matter expert must agree with every single opinion of mine or else they totally contradict my position. My main position is that men are failing to compete, which this expert agrees with, that we got here in part by prioritizing women is a separate issue. However, given that his solution to men doing poorly is to set up programs to help men and boys he is going to have a very difficult time maintaining the argument that all of the attention focused on women and girls but purposefully not males over the last decades has nothing to do with why women are beating men so soundly. I submit that he knows what he is up against with the man hating bitches, and that he is trying to sidestep that landmine...IE it is the political answer and not the truth.

The notion of men not competing well only stands to scrutiny if you cherry-pick your data. If you look at things like salary they are "competing" better than women are, you are just finding data points that support your pre-drawn conclusions.

Men compete just fine, and college admissions are just one facet of many. In most ways to measure it men fare better than do women. You simply are obsessed with a narrative in which men are losing and quote-mining to try to "prove" it.

This is not the first time you've done this, posting "substantiation" that actually directly disagrees with your claims. You shouldn't just google and post the first thing you think "proves" your point and check to see if they actually agree with you in a substantial way.

Look - I don't want anything I say here to be taken as me beating up on males and/or being biased against them etc., because truth is - I'm NOT.
I loved my father, love my son just as much as I love my daughter and truthfully enjoy the company of men moreso than women for the most part. And the women whose company and humor I do enjoy are not your girly girl sort of girls-I don't tend to really get that.

Anyway - it is proven fact that males are more vulnerable and susceptible to all sorts of circumstances from the time they're in the womb.

<quote>
Male Vulnerability - All the Way Back to the Womb :
Gender equality aside, it turns out that baby boys and girls have very distinct responses to stress in the womb, much like grown men and women respond so very differently to stress, out here in the cold, cruel world.

According to Health Day News, Australian researchers studied fetal response to maternal stressors such as poor health and psychological struggle. Vicki Clifton, an associate professor in the pregnancy and development group of the Robinson Institute at the University of Adelaide, said in a news release: "The male, when mum is stressed, pretends it's not happening and keeps growing, so he can be as big as he possibly can be. The female, in response to mum's stress, will reduce her growth rate a little bit; not too much so she becomes growth restricted, but just dropping a bit below average." So let me get this straight — the male pretends he doesn’t know what is going on while he continues to consume all available resources without regard to future scarcity or danger. The female plans ahead, scales back, prepares herself for survival no matter what may be in store. Sounds about right.

I know I sound flip, but it’s just so spot-on. Maybe this biological strategy is one of the reasons there are so many more boys conceived than girls, and yet the live birth rate remains relatively even. Pulling back on resource consumption pays off.
Clifton goes on to explain why: "When there is another complication in the pregnancy — either a different stress or the same one again — the female will continue to grow on that same pathway and do OK, but the male baby doesn't do so well and is at greater risk of pre-term delivery, stopping growing or dying in the uterus."
This male vulnerability doesn’t end at birth. After announcing the results of a 2009 study on pregnancy complications with a male fetus, Professor Marek Glezerman, obstetrician, gynecologist, and expert in gender-based medicine at the TAU School of Medicine, called men biologically weak: "In general, boys are more vulnerable in their life in utero, and this vulnerability continues to exist throughout their lives.
It is a known fact that men have a shorter lifespan, compared to women; they are also more susceptible to different kinds of infections, and do not have such a good chance to withstand disease as women do.
</quote>

So there you have it:
1)If a baby is born prematurely, females are more likely to survive than males.

2) And in terms of school success, boys are diagnosed with learning disabilities of all sorts more than girls - up to and including autism - why is this?:

<quote>
Whether boys are more vulnerable than girls to reading disabilities (RD) is controversial. We review studies that were designed to minimize ascertainment bias in the selection of individuals with RD. These include population-based studies that identified children with RD by objective, unbiased methods and studies that examined the gender ratios among the affected relatives of those diagnosed with RD. We conclude that even when ascertainment biases are minimized, there is still a significant preponderance of boys with RD, although the gender ratio of the affected relatives of those with RD manifests the weakest male bias. Furthermore, we demonstrate that potentially confounding factors such as attentional or neurological problems, race, IQ, and severity of RD cannot account for the observed gender bias. We end with a clarion call to future researchers to (a) consider analyzing gender differences by means of more than one definition of RD, (b) compare gender ratios when boys and girls are ranked against the performance of their own gender as opposed to an average across genders, and (c) report group differences in variability and effect sizes of obtained gender ratios.
</quote>

So maybe what you're seeing is because males are no longer given the societal advantage or edge, at least in American popular culture, the gap has disappeared and the pendulum is swinging the other way now.

As I said, I don't believe that males are inherently weaker - but they do seem to be more susceptible to certain biological setbacks than females- which, when not controlled for by societal bias toward males, tends to work against them.

@aidan,

That's very interesting:)

Women were born to be survivors, we will walk to the end of Earth to save our child, therefore, we'll take what ever job as well to feed them and let's face it, apparently we aren't smart enough to hold high positions, well this generation and the last one beg to differ and so we studied and worked our butt off to get somewhere in life..

Boys, study but then party, party and then study, if there is no job, they will be fine, Mum will feed them, do their washing, or their girlfriend... No drive, motivation, and the knowledge they are safe...

A woman is about to go through a break up, how does she survive is the first thing that comes to her mind....To his mind? #*%t^#a#$ who does she think she is leaving me, oh well plenty of fish in the sea, dang if she is going to take me financially though, I'm going on un-employment, I have no money, Mum let me stay with you til the Divorce is over.....

Yep young men are in trouble if they don't realise we have guts, balls, determination, drive, ambition and can stand on our own two feet.........

Well had to add that in after reading all your other posts....

There are alot of successful "people" in this world....it's a matter of choice, their choice of what "they" want to do with their lives and how they live it when the chips are down....

But the above rings true as well....

One thing I noticed is the willingness of women to have a roommate. All my nieces and young female employees share apartments. The young men I know, out on their own, all have their own apartment. It seems men would rather live at home than share a space. I have no idea if any studies have been done on this, but I remember it going back even to my own post college days. I shared an apartment for 4 years after college until I could afford to have my own place. All the men I dated in my 20's lived alone.

Excuse me, but I'm a feminist and I adore men. I think feminism has helped men as much as it has helped women. Men no longer are expected to be the sole family bread winner who was judged by how much "bacon" he could bring home. Men are no longer looked down upon if they help with the dirtier parts of child care or house work, they are actually admired when they pitch in. Men have been allowed to leave behind the stereotypical roll of the strong silent type who sits behind his newspaper until The Wife calls him in for his meat and potato supper. Men have the freedom to be a full time father and house husband if the woman they partner with has a job that can support a family. Men can tell both their sons and daughters that they can be doctors, lawyers, accountants, artists, dancers, musicians or anything else they want to be without society telling them they are the wrong sex for that profession. Not only have women come along way baby, but so have men. And it's for the better.

Women can only beat men in business by being a lot better. You obviously have never worked in corporate America or you would know that. I worked on Wall St 2 decades ago and I saw some dumbass, lazy men get promoted over much smarter women just because they were men. I saw women having to work much harder and for much longer hours to get even the smallest raise or promotion. I know a brilliant woman, who was billing big bucks for her company, who was always asked to make the coffee for a room full of male colleagues just because she was the only woman present. And that was in 1988. You are clueless.

women were already working harder than men in the same jobs 30 and 40 years ago. the complaint was that the hard work wasn`t paying off. it still isn`t. men still get paid more than women for the same job. the gap on the income side is narrowing, but it`s still there.

part of the problem is that employers recognize they can get more work for less money when they hire women. women are by far a better value proposition for employers.

It didn't matter how hard women worked, it was the Old Boys' Network that still exists to some degree. Men saw women at work as wives or sex objects - like GW and ehBeth have commented on - telling the women to make the coffee, feeling free making sexist jokes in front of them, pinching secretaries on the rear end, etc. I've worked with men who've looked me up and down like I was a piece of meat, but you know, I didn't whine, file a complaint, or go to the Ombudsman - just ignored the assholes and sucked it up.

The fact that some young men are having a tough time means they have to do what we did, 20 - 30 years ago - apply ourselves and work harder. It's do-able, so they should up and do it.

You really ought to quit whining - and instead of all this talk, talk, talk, why not go where the problem exists and help those young men out? You have an issue? DEAL WITH IT. DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. As I said before, talk is cheap!

What makes you think men who behave like this do so in front of other men? Most know better than to have witnesses. I've had my share of inappropriate comments and stares in my day, but I don't think the majority of them included more than the one man being present. I once had a male co-worker snap my bra strap against my back while on an elevator which he apparently thought was fun and flirty. His friend told him "to stop being an ass or I'll hold you down while she kicks you in nuts", which I thought was rather gallant of him in a crude sort of way. But mostly, like Mame, I've ignored any sexist behavior and just tried never to be alone again with the person. It would be a rare woman who has made it to middle age who has not experienced inappropriate remarks, leers and groping. Certainly not all men do this, but the ones who do make up for all the ones who don't.

I don't hate men in spite of those experiences. It's not so cut and dried. I can differentiate a boor from a nice guy, you know. Not everyone's an asshole. I know that, and so do most women.

Yes - I had heard this too. But I've seen it as well - personally it always seemed that more young men lived at home with their parents than young women.

Wonder why more young women move out of their parent's home than young men.

@hawkeye10,

I also think that men (or boys) care less - as long as they have a place to sleep and food.

Women for the most part, care about their apartment/home situation more.

At least this is what I've experienced in the first 5 years out of college.

@Green Witch,

funny my experience was the opposite - not that women were unwilling to have a roommate, but the men that moved out tended to have more roommates - many I knew would even rent a house and have several roommates, where women tended to have one or two roommates at the most.

I don't know that hawk is obsessed with gender so much as obsessed with people who are obsessed with gender who will run things off a cliff if somebody doesn't stand up to them. In that case he is obsessed with us not being run off a cliff. Which is fairly heroic imo.

@aidan,

Are you really saying, Rebecca, that women are not very good at consuming all available resources without regard to future scarcity or danger.

You could have fooled a donkey with such a ridiculous idea but not ol' spendi. A recent survey showed that the average British woman has 39 pirs of shoes. Ask a plumber to guess the average number of bottles in a lady's bathroom.

Somebody once said that the world doesn't let a good looking woman starve. And they are all good looking to somebody.

I don't give a damn about the status of young men. It's the economy that matters and the simple and obvious fact is that the rise of feminism has coincided with deficits of such extraordinary proportions that politicians don't know what to do about them.

True that, but also I am outraged that the lie is spread around that men tend to be little shits who want to abuse women, as we know by the alleged long history of men abusing women. It is all an outrageous lie, it is character assassination pure and simple....men must begin to stand up for ourselves, and women must demand that the feminists cease and desist their aggression against men. If the feminists refuse (as I expect they would) then women must stand up and say that they like men, and make it clear that the feminists do not represent them.

There is indeed a lot of abuse going on, but it is flowing in the opposite direction from what the feminists, media and government claim that it is.

US wealth gap between young and old is widest ever

<quote>
- The wealth gap between younger and older Americans has stretched to the widest on record, worsened by a prolonged economic downturn that has wiped out job opportunities for young adults and saddled them with housing and college debt.

The typical U.S. household headed by a person age 65 or older has a net worth 47 times greater than a household headed by someone under 35, according to an analysis of census data released Monday.

While people typically accumulate assets as they age, this wealth gap is now more than double what it was in 2005 and nearly five times the 10-to-1 disparity a quarter-century ago, after adjusting for inflation.

The analysis reflects the impact of the economic downturn, which has hit young adults particularly hard. More are pursuing college or advanced degrees, taking on debt as they wait for the job market to recover. Others are struggling to pay mortgage costs on homes now worth less than when they were bought in the housing boom.

The report, coming out before the Nov. 23 deadline for a special congressional committee to propose $1.2 trillion in budget cuts over 10 years, casts a spotlight on a government safety net that has buoyed older Americans on Social Security and Medicare amid wider cuts to education and other programs, including cash assistance for poor families.

"It makes us wonder whether the extraordinary amount of resources we spend on retirees and their health care should be at least partially reallocated to those who are hurting worse than them," said Harry Holzer, a labor economist and public policy professor at Georgetown University who called the magnitude of the wealth gap "striking."

The median net worth of households headed by someone 65 or older was $170,494. That is 42 percent more than in 1984, when the Census Bureau first began measuring wealth broken down by age. The median net worth for the younger-age households was $3,662, down by 68 percent from a quarter-century ago, according to the analysis by the Pew Research Center.

So I have been looking at this website for years but to ashamed to write on it because someone might know i was in the family but I left when I was 9 and am now 27 and still haven't gotten over the abuse and the fear of dying that I got because of the family. I have tried to live a "normal" life but i just feel insane my family acts like we were never in the family and my parents like to act like they were good parents but I never even saw them growing up.

Then the best thing to do is to distance yourself from them.

@clarav21,

clara, the site owner, Robert Gentel, was part of the family at one point and
perhaps he checks in and will give you his take.

In the meantime, try to get some counseling and build up a support system.
Do you have any friends who could help you walk through this? Your parents might be too deep into the cult to realize what they've done to their kid(s). They might be brainwashed and can't help themselves.

The good thing is that you found a way out and that you're trying to seek
help.

You don't say what the "family" cult is. Can you ID it, in a general way?

The family next door is Jehovah Witness. They have "shunned" one daughter because she left the home and lives in a "worldly" way. Another daughter is held at a distance because she is not a believer. But if the parents want to see the two grandchildren, they keep their mouth shut about religion. The last daughter, age 16, is beginning to "rebel" because she wants to hang out with her friends. Depression runs in this family.

These adults feel that they are doing the right thing.

The cult is the "family". I believe they have their own site tied to A2K. Hopefully someone can point you in that direction.
My heart aches for the pain and suffering you feel, that they caused. Have you tried counseling? You have to know that you are not to blame and that these feelings seem to be normal amongst the survivors but you are worth so much more. I hope you will be able to love yourself and get past all that crap. Good luck.

Thanks everyone and yes I have tried counseling but it has only been at the VA because I'm a disabled vet also. Most of the time I'm so ashamed to even tell the therapist because my family has cut me off for talking about it. Even my siblings who i love very much feel like they have to protect my parents from me because im the evil one that won't get over my past. I feel so alone, and I have told a couple people but they just say I shouldn't talk about it but I feel like I'm holding a secret inside thats killing me and i don't know why im so ashamed I was born into the cult and I was 9 when we ran away so I know i couldn't change it but I can't act normal like my family wants to either.

@clarav21,

Keep talking. Don't ever let anyone shut you up. When terrible things happen to us, it's the only way to get over it. Therapists are there to help, don't keep this a secret, talk, talk, talk. Get it out, release the burden. Use the services available to you, a VA therapist is there to help you. Doesn't matter where they work, they've got the training to help. USE IT.
Guilt and shame are useless feelings, especially when it was never your fault.

Please don't feel ashamed of yourself, it is absolutely not your fault what happened to you and your family. There is nothing to feel ashamed about,

My grandfather's memoirs
</headline>
<post author="cavfancier" datetime="2003-04-30T08:18:00" id="p1">
Technically, this is not my original writing, but my grandfather's. This biography was found after he died. He never told anyone in the family that he was even writing this. This is the relative I feel I have the most in common with, intellectually, and it is a great read, in my opinion, with tons of history. While the family works on considering it for conversion into a screenplay, I post it here, in his honour (be patient with the scrolling, it is 98 pages, but that is double-spaced, and apologies for strange characters...they were in cyrillic in the original manuscript <img src="http://cdn2.able2know.org/images/v5/emoticons/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy"/> ):

June 1992

This all started at a Sunday brunch hosted by Toots and me. The occasion was in honour of Jonathan Strauss's Bar Mitzvah. There were our own families from Toronto and Winnipeg as well as almost all our Winnipeg friends.
When lunch was done Arla rose to thank our guests and then asked for Alex to come to the lectern.
I was startled to hear him bring up my approaching 80th birthday which doesn't come till the end of August. He had recalled my previous tales of my adventures in Russia and my early school days in Winnipeg - life on Pritchard Avenue and my Bar Mitzvah. He recalled my boasting of getting gifts of 4 fat, orange Parker Pens. Nothing had greater status value than one of those Parkers.
He forthwith presented me with a collectors item of a replica of a Parker Duofold. I was dumbfounded with surprise. I have no recollection as to what I said in response. Perhaps it's just as well.
The children have goaded me often to write something of my long life. Now that I have such a fine writing instrument I can't resist the challenge.
What follows is an unusually long letter addressed to my children and grandchildren both Natural and acquired by virtue of my second marriage to Toots.
I'd imagine that strangers trying to read this long and rambling epistle would find it boring and tedious. But the more immediate family may find parts of it informative.
In any event as a family chronology it may prove useful.

REFLECTIONS

According to my mother my birth was the most dreadful experience of her life. The pain and suffering she experienced was beyond description. The whole neighbourhood for blocks around was aroused by her agonizing screams. This scenario lasted for two whole days until I was finally expelled. The telling of this tale was probably intended to instil a sense of deep quiet in me. Strangely it never did.
This even took place deep in the heart of the Ukraine in a small city called Uman, south of Kiev - the capital and half way to the Black Sea City of Odessa. My world atlas, which is at least 30 years old lists its population at about 70,000. It must have been a fairly presentable little city with a public park called An Sofiafka; there were banks and a public lending library.
My birth certificate states that I was born on August 10, 1912. This being the Gregorian calendar converted to the European as August 23rd. And so it has always been.
Being born prior to World War I gives me a feeling of historical proportions particularly when watching an Edwardian movie or a play by Shaw or Oscar Wilde. I feel somewhat awestruck - that's how people dressed and lived when I was a small child. And people used hansom cabs and cobblestone streets were this "modern" paving method.
My father Jacob was 26 when I was born. His birthday and mine coincided on August 23rd. He was an only child. His father Abraham and mother Rose were "dirt" poor. So poor that hunger and severe deprivation was a constant companion. Charitable neighbours kept an eye on them to ensure that there was a fresh baked loaf of bread for the Sabbath.
In the years preceding my grandfather surnames were unknown. Men were identified as the "son of". Or for further clarification also the village or town of their origin. My grandfather's people came from the city of Medzhibosch in the far western reaches of the Ukraine. Amongst the religious Jews it was noted that this town was the home of the B'Sl Shem Tov a noted sage of the 17th Century. Consequently by my grandfather, he became known as Abraham the Medzhibezar. How my father became fluent in Russian and how he became an excellent bookkeeper remains a mystery to me. Moreover, how he managed to get a job in a Russian bank is also a mystery. In view of the fact the anti-Jewish laws and regulations were extremely restrictive in Czarist Russia it was a great accomplishment for him to have done what he did. To Russianize his name he acquired the surname Medzhbeezer - which of course was derived from the name Medzhibosch - the ancestral town.
My mother was 20 when I was born. She came from a much more affluent family. Her father was AKIBA Freivoch - a wine merchant. Most of his wine was imported from western Russia from a district now called Moldavia. He usually made 2 trips annually to the capital town of Kishiriev. The wine was shipped home in huge caskets which were moved to the basement of his house. A dark, damp, cold and spooky place. I was forbidden to ever venture down there - on penalty of some dreadful punishment. My mother was the eldest of twelve children --
She was named Brushka which in Yiddish is a diminutive of the Hebrew word Brucha - which in literal translation means Blessed.
Only 3 of whom survived. My auntie Jenine who married Max Schwartzman and settled in New York. My uncle Zalman (Sam) who joined our family in Winnipeg. My grandmother was Esther. She died in her thirties of the complications of diabetes.
The dwelling in Uman must have been quite modern by the standards of that day. I recall quite clearly a solitary bare electric light bulb hanging from the centre of the ceiling in the most important room in the house - the kitchen, living room and dining room combined. An enormous oven occupied the furthest wall. It was built as part of the kitchen. Above it as far as the ceiling was a spacious crawl space which served as a bedroom for the "shiksa". The lucky girl had the warmest, cosiest place in the house. Bread baking day was the highlight of the week. The smell of baking bread permeated the house. A smell delicious and mouth watering beyond belief. Entrance to and from the house was from the kitchen. The gate from the street led to an enclosed garden dominated by a cherry tree. The door to the kitchen was at right angle to the street.
The language of my grandparents was Yiddish and I imagine that this was the language I first learned as an infant. There is absolutely nothing that I can recall about a teacher or a school. I doubt that I was ever taught anything formally in my early childhood. One of the mysteries which has always perplexed me was how I learned to speak Russian and read and write the language before I was six.
There was a library close to home where I was known and the lady in charge would let me borrow books. I must have been a fairly precocious child for I read everything I could lay my hands on.
One day while reading a book I was started and bewildered by coming across the word "???" in page after page all underlined by some previous reader. The word (zhid) is a highly derogatory term for Jew in Russian and Ukranian. I recall crying when I showed my mother the book. It was my first encounter with open Anti-Semitism.
In some way I became aware that the family to which I belonged was different than the people inhabiting the rest of the community. I became frightened at the sight of an approaching priest. The blackness of their long cloaks, their black shirts acting as a perfect foil for their long and heavy necklaces suspending a very ponderous cross. Their black beards and tall black hats added to their ominous appearance.
At the sight of one I tried desperately to cross to the other side of the street. I had many friends my real best friend was Grisha Freivoch - my mother's uncle's only child. We were the same age and were inseparable. I think it was he who taught me how to jinx the evil spell that a passing priest might cast. You ran into the nearest "back alley" and emptied your bladder simultaneously with your friend. It was essential that the two urine streams intersected to form a cross. Another friend was a girl called Paula. Also a relative of sorts. We enjoyed playing doctor and patient. Naturally, I was the doctor. One day I decided to vaccinate Paula. I found a sharp piece of broken glass on the street and proceeded to scratch her upper arm with it. When blood started to stream down her arm she ran screaming into the house. I was punished sufficiently to never do it again.
Grisha and I also participated in our first sex lesson. Another little girl in the neighbourhood proposed a challenge to us. If we showed her our penises she would show us her genitals. We readily accepted but were terribly perplexed how anyone could urinate without a penis.
One day I nagged my mother dreadfully to allow me to do something. She continued to deny me my wish so in desperation I threatened her. If she continued to say "no" I would go to the pantry and start breaking jars of jam which had laboriously been "put out"; when this thread didn't produce results I calmly went about smashing some jars. This serious misdemeanour did not go unpunished. Another embarrassing episode occurred when I overheard my parents plan to go to the cinema to see the famous comedian Max Linder. This would be about 1917 before Charlie Chaplin displaced him. Naturally I was ignored and put to bed. I awoke an hour or two later to find my parents gone. Fortunately it was a warm spring or summer evening. I knew perfectly well where the cinema was. I ran barefooted in my night clothes to the cinema and yelled and screamed at the doorman to let me in to find papa and mama. Those were silent movies so I don't think I disturbed too many. My parents were mortified and embarrassed. I don't know how this tale of a wilful child ended.
Ominous clouds began to gather over the life of our little family. My father was fortunately spared the draft into the army. The reason being that being a bank employee was considered an essential service. Jewish boys would try every possible avenue in their efforts to avoid being drafted. This desperation was not prompted by fear of action or enemy fire but by the fear of the cruelty inflicted on them by the Christian soldiers.
In 1917 Lenin returned to Russia to head the Bolshevik revolution. His first act other than murdering the Czar and his family was the signing of a peace treaty with Germany. All I can remember about those distant days were endless discussions amongst the grownups. What would life be like under German occupation. Surely it couldn't be worse than under the Czar. Little did they know what was in store for them.
During the period of 1917-18 I contracted my first serious illness. A classical case of scarlet fever. A disease which no younger doctor has ever seen. After this fever and rash subsided came the period of desquamation. Huge pieces of skin peeled off, particularly my hands and feet. But I was far from finished with the disease. About a week or two after I thought I was fully recovered I had a classical complication. The condition is called nephrosis. I became enormously swollen. I had to rest for another several weeks until I was pronounced cured.
Life for our family became progressively far difficult and complicated. In late summer 1918 the War in Europe came to an end. But not in Russia. Allied forces fearing the spread of Bolshevism invaded Russia from all sides. Russian soldiers led by various generals loyal to the ousted monarchy and called "White Russians" fought on various fronts against the hated Bolsheviks. In the Ukraine the situation was the worst of all. There a whole variety of murderous leaders fought the White Russian soldiers, the Bolsheviks and quite often each other in their efforts to establish an independent Ukraine. All these factions terrorized vast stretches of the Ukraine. Pillage, destruction and murder dominated their activities. The slaughter of Jews became a game to avenge the death of Jesus the Saviour. I can recall vividly the days and nights of hiding in various cellars. One day while in our kitchen the family was surprised when a group of drunken soldiers invaded the house. In those days the most dreaded of all the Ukranian partisan armies was one headed by a notorious anti-Semite called Petlura. The mounted soldiers most of them sporting fierce bushy moustaches, tall caracul hats, rifles on their backs with crossed ammunition belts on their tunics. Often flashing their curved sabres provided a spine chilling fearsome spectacle. When lubricated with booze, they became executioners of anyone in their way.
One day, quite unexpectedly a group of them burst into our house. They had heard that there was wine to be had. I have no idea where my father was but at home was my grandfather and my uncle Sam. The kitchen table was very large and could easily seat a dozen or more people around it. The wine jugs and glasses were on it. The two Jewish men were forced under the table while the drunken orgy became more and more boisterous. When they decided to go elsewhere one of them began taking pot shots with his rifle at the two men beneath the table. Soon they all joined in the fun. When it was time to go my grandfather lay dead and my uncle lay bleeding profusely from a cheek wound. Undoubtedly they thought he too was dead.
I find it hard to believe that the recollection of these horrors remains so vividly etched in my memory. After all it was probably 1919 and I couldn't have been more than 7 years of age.
Events which followed bring nothing to mind. All I know and recollect was that suddenly my father appeared in a uniform and the three of us were on a train headed for the big city of Kiev. There my father had secured a bookkeeping job in a military hospital. Now life seemed to undergo a complete change. We spoke only Russian and my parents acquired a group of friends and frequently participated in raucous parties. After being put to bed, I could hear laughter and singing coming from another part of the hospital.
Before long I acquired a Russian friend. He must have been somewhat older than me. He taught me a great deal about the hospital. It was not only a place to help wounded soldiers but was also a place where undesirables were shot. Executions took place every morning. The roof above "our" building was flat and easily accessible. If you got there early enough you could watch the execution squad march their victims to an adjoining room and listen with bated breath for its sound of the rifle shots.
Later in the day when it was safe we would search the nearby wood for the discarded shell casings. My education was very grizzly for a child my age.
Unknown to me, my parents were busy planning a way to escape from the nightmare of life in Russia.

CHAPTER 2

Russia was in a dreadful state of violence in 1919-1920. The "White" Russians who were the remains of the Imperial Army were led by the aristocratic officer corps. They were financed, armed and helped by the victorious allied and American forces. The revolutionary Bolsheviks were led by a self taught general called Leon Trotzky. The man was undoubtedly a genius. Leading his scattered ragtag armies he not only deported the invaders from western Europe but also the expeditionary American forces attacking him in Pacific Siberia. It was not until these victories were achieved that he turned his energies to pacifying the Ukraine. During their constant warfare political warfare raged in Moscow. The democratic movement had temporarily gained the upper hand under the leadership of one called Kerevsky in 1917. New currency was issued to replace the Imperial ruble. But when the Bolshevik revolution triumphed in October 1917 he fled the country and with his departure died any hope of a nascent democracy.
Naturally I knew nothing of these events and was totally unaware of the plans my parents were secretly hatching to escape from the bloody turmoil around them. It must have been during the winter of 1919-20 that they started the long trek westward.
It being winter I was clothed in a voluminous coat. Little did I know that my mother had sewn bundles of paper currency inside the lining. I now know that the objective was to reach the vicinity of the Dniester river. This was the political border between Russia and Roumania. It was heavily patrolled by both Russian and Roumanian troops. It was strictly prohibited to cross the river. Guards were instructed to shoot on sight at any intruder.
Apparently the plan commonly tried was to bribe a farmer along the riverbank to transport you by row boat across the river. The boat ride had be done in pitch darkness in utter silence. Once you were across the river on the Roumanian side, you were on your own.
The area we were dropped off was heavily wooded and because of this pitch darkness almost at once I was alone and lost. My parents didn't dare shout for me and I wandered about in the darkness by this time too frightened to cry.
I do know that at day break two women approached me and asked if I was Yosh and Brushka's boy. Soon we were reunited and were fed and sheltered in a farmer's dwelling.
The next hurdle was getting to Kirshinev the main city in that part of Moldavia. How we got there I have no idea. I now know that the main purpose of establishing residence there was to be free to communicate with the rest of the world.
My auntie Jenine and her husband were already safe in New York and were anxious for us to join them there. Unfortunately for us the open door for European refugees had just been closed by US immigration.
Fortunately my mother remembered an auntie who had emigrated to Winnipeg, Canada years before. Naturally there were married cousins there, the closest one to her age was Sonia who was married to a Barney Portigal. Letters between my parents and her Winnipeg cousin began to flow. An immigration permit had to be secured. Then there was the booking of passage across half of Europe, across the Atlantic and then again by train across Canada to Winnipeg. My parents were quite ignorant of world geography, they had never heard of Winnipeg and as for Canada they had heard of it as a cold and distant part of America. The fact that it was in America made them glow with eager anticipation. After all if the community was in "America" it couldn't be that far from New York.
How we got to Kishinev or how we managed to get living accommodation there is an unknown chapter to me. By this time it was already 1920 and my resistance to disease must have been very low particularly after being so ill with scarlet fever. This time I became gravely ill with lobar pneumonia. The doctor attending me told my parents to wait for the "crisis" to occur for without it I would surely die. The phenomenon of a lobar pneumonia crisis was a dramatic occurrence. Particularly in children it was the difference between life and death. Once has to visualize a child desperately ill with severe difficulty breathing and a fever of at least 40°C, sometimes higher. Within an hour the same desperately ill child undergoes a remarkable change. The temperature drops precipitously to normal levels, the difficulty in breathing is alleviated. Nothing is more dramatic in medical history. Since the advent of antibiotics few if any doctors have witnessed this phenomenon.
My convalescence must have been slow. To Eastern Europeans oranges represented the ultimate food for a quick recovery. Every day I was given an orange and watched by everyone as I consumed the fruit. Another daily ritual was the washing of my hair followed by meticulous combing with a special fine tooth come to ensure the elimination of head lice. My mother was a firm believer in the spontaneous generation of all kinds of tiny creatures - including mice.
I continued to have health problems. In order to secure visas to emigrate to Canada we had to submit for health examinations. On examination it was diagnosed that I was developing trachoma of my eyes. This is a contagious disease which untreated can lead to blindness. It is endemic in Africa and in Egypt in particular where it was the leading cause of blindness. I recall very vividly being put on a stretcher and immobilized with restraints. The doctor and his female assistants were socializing and babbling away in some strange language, probably Roumanian. My eyelids were everted and scraped vigorously with some sort of curette. Then the raw areas was cauterized with a chemical. I had no anaesthetic. My screams still ring in my ears after more than 70 years. The treatment was quite inhuman but nevertheless probably effective.

What is the purpose of writing of personal events occurring three quarters of a century ago? My life's accomplishments are much too modest for that. Genealogy seems to have acquired a fashionable resurgence in America and Canada. My distant "cousin" in Chicago Paula Gordon has written me many times regarding family roots. Toots' family the Comisaroffs have a very large company stretching from Australia, the U.S., Canada and Israel. There have been reunions of this far flung membership - although Toots has never attended but the Gutkins and Strausses were at the last one in San Francisco. Even my brother Ken has recently written inquiring about our family roots.
Whether this exercise in autobiography will be of interest to my children or grandchildren only time will tell. Certainly the clock is running out on me. I'll be 80 in August and if I don't make the effort now I'm afraid this opportunity will expire. I certainly can't afford the luxury of an experienced ghost writer to dramatize and embellish the simple events of one's life.

To return to the evens in Kishinev. After surviving the horrors of Trachoma and lobar pneumonia the wherewithal to travel to America arrived. There were passports and visas to secure and passage to be booked.
Finally our long voyage westward began. Our first destination was Antwerp where it was hoped passage could be booked to Canada.
The trip across the continent was long and very arduous. Getting food was a constant challenge. After several days of moving and stopping we finally reached the German city of Cologne. My parents discovered that the train would have a stopover there of several hours. This was a great opportunity for them to try and get some food.
I was given strict instructions not to leave my seat during their absence. I don't know how I amused myself during their absence, but I did as I was told. Suddenly, to my horror the train began to move. Unknown to me of course we were in a huge marshalling yard. I became hysterical with fear at being abandoned in a strange foreign land. I have no idea how long it took for my parents to find our train and, me. Whether or not they secured some food was quite uninallred to me.
Finally we arrived in Antwerp. Another strange city in another foreign land. Our arrival there was in the winter of 1920-21 and I was now a mature child of 8. One of the problems faced by my parents was finding shelter and provisions. Then there was booking passage for the long trans-Atlantic voyage to Canada. Passage was finally found and booked on a steamer called the "Scandinaves". It was a nightmarish voyage. The accommodation was steerage. Everyone was deathly ill with seasickness. No sooner were we halfway across the Atlantic when again I became very ill with a classic case of red measles. I was isolated by the ship's doctor. Immediately, on arrival in Quebec City we were transported to a quarantined island in the Gulf of Saint Lawrence called Grose Isle. My illness was further prolonged by a relapse and recurrence of the kidney disease nephrosis. My convalescence was not unpleasant. The quarantine station on this island was clean, the food was good and the surroundings were beautiful with lush greenery, flowers and trees all around.
Finally, after being cleared by the authorities, we were transported to Quebec city where we boarded a train for the interminably long trip to Winnipeg.
I have absolutely no recollection of the three or four days we spent on the Canadian Pacific Railroad. I presume it was the CPR because I do recall clearly getting off at the Higgins and Main station.
We were met by a delegation of Portigal cousins. All were total strangers babbling to each other in an incomprehensible lingo. I was dutifully kissed and patted on the head.
We were welcomed at the station by my mother's first cousins Sonia and her husband Barney. Another cousin Clara, cousins Fanny, Becky and cousin Fanny and finally the youngest one Anette. The only male cousin was Sam. All were called Portigal. I don't know why. Their mother, my mother's true Auntie, didn't show and her name is long forgotten.
The Portigal house was a frame house west of Main Street on a street called Burrows adjacent to a fire hall. Our taxi ride from the station to the Portigal house revealed a north main Street of unbelievable ugliness. To add to the bleakness of the street was the constant explosion of firecrackers. We didn't know they were firecrackers we thought it was gunfire. It took a little explanation to reassure us and explain that it was traditional to celebrate May 24th with fireworks.
Having come from a relatively handsome European city such as Kiev the initial impression of Winnipeg was extremely poor. In any event we were reassured that Canada was a peaceful happy country and that it wouldn't be long before we were established. Sonia and Barney had two children, Aubie their little boy was about 4 or 5 years old and Esther their daughter was 7. Communication was difficult. I was forbidden to speak Russian. The hatred for that country was too great for my parents to think clearly and objectively. I communicated to the grown ups in Yiddish. To the other 2 children in the house I have no recollection of communicating with them at all.
I must have had an aptitude for languages. When it was time to enrol me in Macaray school sometime in August my command of English was reasonably good. I turned 9 on August 23, 1921 and a week later I was already in Grade I.
Life was beginning on a more predictable pattern. Two important events took place. My father got a job as a bookkeeper with a financial institution and we managed to rent 2 or 3 rooms on Redwood Ave. near Salter and next door to Dyson's vinegar factory. By this time my uncle Zalman or Sam, as he became known, had arrived in Winnipeg. He got a job and moved in with us. It was only with the money he contributed for his board and room that "we" were able to make ends meet.
My father's salary was $35.00 per month. I have no idea how his employers communicated with him. His knowledge of English was zero but his ambition to learn was infinite. He would practice words and phrases endlessly. It was my duty to correct his mistakes. He enjoyed strolling down the street and read signs and billboards. He would hold my hand and we'd walk along Salter till Selkirk Avenue. There were many signs along the way. It was very difficult for him to "unlearn" the Cyrillic alphabet with its phonetic spelling and pronunciation to the Roman alphabet and the intricacies of English spelling and pronunciation.
School proved very pleasant. At first I was one of the big boys in class. I had just turned nine and almost all the other children were either five or six. By Christmas I was in grade 2 and shortly after that in grade 3 and in grade 4.
After our arrival in Canada my mother's cousins decided to Anglicise our surname. The decided on MESBUR and so we became known. Jacob was easy. My mother became Bertha and I remained unchanged as Boris.
Life on Redwood avenue was very difficult. The stench from the vinegar factory was at times overpowering. The kitchen which was the dominant room consisted of a sink and a cold water tap. The stove was a wood contraption, water for washing had to be heated in a tub. Serving a cup of tea meant lighting the stove to boil the water. In spite of this hardship my mother became pregnant. Esther was born in July 1922. She cried constantly and needed rocking to keep her quiet. I became a full time helper. After school I was busy with household tasks. I became adept at washing the kitchen floor and hanging the washed diapers on the clothes line. Once or twice a week I was delegate the task of baby sitting. I dreaded being left alone with the baby. She invariably cried, sometimes so violently she would hold her breath and frighten me to tears. Life became increasingly difficult in our primitive cramped quarters. To compound our difficulties my parents quarelled constantly. It was impossible for me to escape the perpetual insults, the nagging, the blaming of all our troubles on one another. School was a wonderful respite and a refuge from the domestic turmoil. My command of English was totally in keeping with my age and I was told I had no trace of a residual foreign accent. But I had no friends. I think it was my shyness and inferiority complex which stifled my social instincts.
My parents' social life was much better than mine. My mother had her cousin to visit with and my father became a founding member of the Achdus Free Loan Society. Naturally he became the society bookkeeper. Many of the members of the Achdus were new immigrants. Most of them were in dire circumstances all striving to extricate themselves from the poverty which was the lot of most of them. Many tried to become established in little businesses. Naturally some needed a bookkeeper and my father began to acquire a reputation as a "wonderful" accountant of impeccable credentials.
Sometime after my sister's birth probably in 1923 we moved to a "suite" on Prtichard Avenue. The house accommodated 3 families. Two immigrant families lived on the main floor and we occupied the top floor. Entrance was through a side door and up a narrow steep flight of stairs. I now had my own bedroom There was a bathroom with a sink and a tub as well as a toilet. The water was icy cold from the single tap. In the kitchen the stove which burned both wood and coal was in constant use. I became the chief hauler of wood and coal from the outdoor storage. Not only were there more floors for me to wash but also the steep stairs leading to our home had to be kept immaculately clean.
Fortunately I was never burdened with homework. Whatever was assigned at school I did during school hours. I was an excellent student and before long I joined the more select students in classes with a higher standard. Particularly those who would go on to high school and possibly university.
My social life finally took off. Our neighbours were all Jewish and with many children my own age - I acquired real friends and for the first time in my short life I became a member of a social group. We played games together and engaged in occasional warfare with Catholic children attending the adjacent Holy Ghost School on Selkirk Ave. Then I was enrolled in the Talmud Torah Hebrew School. The social life there was great but I hated the teachers and the compulsory subjects in Hebrew. It was an additional burden I had to endure.
I continued going to Macaray school. The teachers were excellent and although I continued to do no homework my grades were uniformly in the high 80s or 90s. Grades 7, 8 and 9 were considered "Junior" high school. In junior high one achieved the privilege of different teachers for different subjects.
In 1925 I went into "training" for my Bar Mitzvah. I acquired an elderly Jewish tutor who came to our house 2 or 3 times a week. He taught me the basics and I managed to learn the monotonous chanting of the mathir. Following this service at the Talmud Torah synagogue our relatives and my parents' friends trudged up the stairs for lunch. The lunch had been laboriously prepared by my mother just prior to the celebration. Refrigeration was with a block of ice which in the summer's heat had to be replaced daily. Electric refrigeration or freezers had not yet been invented. I was more interested in the gifts which I anticipated getting. There were only two gifts which thrilled me. Fat, yellow, Parker pens and watches. The Bar Mitzvah netted me 4 Parker pens and a CYMA wristwatch. There were also some other miscellaneous gifts which didn't particularly interest me.
The lunch food which had been laboriously prepared the week preceding was "gefilte" fish, herring and I presume the complimentary items. The birthday which was in August - a season when garden fresh produce were bountiful. On the whole this affair was judged to be successful and my performance in the synagogue satisfactory. I was thrilled at the thought and anticipation that my compulsory religious and Hebrew education at the Talmud Torah was coming to an end. My parents wanted me to continue but apparently only halfheartedly because my refusal to go on was grudgingly accepted. I now was free to play and fool around after school. I was still my mother's helper. There were floors to wash, wood to be brought to the kitchen, garbage and ashes to be disposed of and dishes to be dried after meals. I can recall that I was actually happy.
One day a bombshell fell. My father had been doing fairly well with his bookkeeping and had managed to save several hundred dollars. What better investment to make that to move us out of the slums and buy a real house. One that we could call our own. One was found for the outrageous sum of $2,000.00. It was at the northern outskirts of the city. In a muddy unpaved street called Junster. The street cars ended their routes a block or two behind our house in what was then called the "North End" car burns. The house itself was a two storey white house dwelling. The main floor consisted of the kitchen, living and dining rooms. On the top floor were 3 bedrooms and a bathroom. The house was heated by a real coal fired furnace in the basement.
There was even a ramshackle garage in the backyard. The front of the house was dominated by a verandah which was not screened. During the summer Winnipeg was already famous for the hordes or mosquitoes which descended on any unprotected warm blooded animal. Humans were their favourite target.
Macaray school continued as my educational home. We had some excellent teachers. Particularly in English, French and Latin, History and Mathematics. My class was considered to be the brightest and most promising in the entire school. I also achieved some notoriety as an "artist" and I has chosen to decorate various school projects. My class was also noted by the fact that with the exception of one pupil it was entirely Jewish. The one pupil was a girl called Cicely Skinner. She had the knack of getting 100 in almost all the subjects. She was not a particularly attractive child but I held her in awe.
My artistic notoriety led to my enrolment in the Winnipeg Art School My teacher was the subsequently famous artist Jerome Fitzgerald. Mr. Fitzgerald was hardly aware of my presence. I learned nothing and showed little inclination to pursue an artistic career.
During this period I became a Boy Scout. I recall our scout master, a very young one called Dan Krindle. The number of our troop was the 49th and as to be expected was all Jewish. Our main preoccupation was achieving a badge designation. I had the distinction of being the only one having an Artist Badge. The badges were attached to the upper sleeve below the shoulders. During the summer we went camping on the shores of lake Winnipeg at a place called Boundary Park. My only footwear were canvas running shoes. Our scout master decided that we were to go hiking one weekend. The distance we were to cover was about 10 miles and at the end of this trek my feet were badly blistered and bleeding.
I was still in Macaray school but in Junior High. One day we were shown a primitive radio receiver called a crystal set. My imagination was fuelled with excitement. How could something pluck speech and music from the air?
Radio was a new phenomenon at the time and had barely arrived in Winnipeg. There was one station opened by Manitoba Telephones for only a few hours per day. I come across a plan for building a home receiver. I needed money to buy parts. The only convertible asset I had was my stamp collection. A dealer took advantage of my youth. I was 14 at the time. He offered me $15.00 for the lot. This was not a trivial sum at the time. I learned may years later that some of the very early Queen Victoria issues were subsequently worth as much as $1,000.00. In 1926 $15.00 represented the wherewithal to buy my coveted components. Radio continued to be my passion for some years to come. While I was assembling my set my parents were ridiculing my efforts. In desperation I challenged my father to put up or shut up. He agreed to give me a dollar if it worked. It finally worked and I collected my bet. My mother who had joined my father in belittling my efforts became busy on the phone to her relations and friends boasting of her son's accomplishments.
Radio became an all consuming passion. I would spend countless hours fiddling with the dials and entering new and distant stations. To this day I recall familiar call letters like KDKA Pittsburgh, KSL Salt Lake City, WCCO Minneapolis, WBBM Chicago and hundreds of four others which I logged over a period of time. These were also the days when my musical career flourished. Shortly after moving to Inkster Blvd. my father decided that a musical instrument was an essential possession in a cultured family. He bought a Heinzman upright and was immediately accepted as a pupil by a young woman called Miss Kidd. We got along well and my progress was very rapid. I enjoyed playing pieces much too difficult for me to play.
Unfortunately as often happens my mother began to interfere. I was constantly nagged to practice and worst of all my mother insisted I perform for her friends at every opportunity. I detested her friends and relations. They were so patronizing and condescending.
By the time I was in Grade 9 my final year at Macaray school my mother became pregnant. I was disgusted and ashamed that people their age would stoop to having sexual intercourse. My mother would blame my father for this unwanted pregnancy. Ken was born in September 1928 shortly after my sixteenth birthday.
Our grade 9 class was singled out as outstanding and was chosen to take grades 10 and 11 in one year at St. John's High School. As it happened that summer became notorious for its epidemic of poliomyelitis. The epidemic raged on into September. The school board decided to postpone opening the new school year till Oct. 1st. The shortened year did not interfere with the proposed grades 10 and 11 combination. Most of us did not sense any challenge in the increased work load. I continued to do no homework but managed presentable marks at exam time. My graduation was a forgone conclusion. I was fascinated with Hans Zinsser's book about the great men who make momentous discoveries regarding diseases ravaging mankind. There was Koch and tuberculosis, Pasteur and rabies, Erlich and syphilis and others. I made up my mind that I would be a doctor and hopefully make some discoveries to help mankind. My father agreed to medicine but my mother kept nagging me that engineering was a much superior career. Her friends were very knowledgeable about careers and they insisted about the merits of engineering. There was really no urgency in deciding. I needed 2 years of pre-med studies which could be converted to engineering if necessary.
University was considered to be very expensive. The registration fee for all necessary classes was $100.00. I recall taking botany, zoology, mathematics, English, German and physics. I had still not learned proper study habits and my marks although adequate were far below my potential. In those days the University was located downtown along what is now Memorial Boulevard. Hazing of freshmen was now an established custom. I did not escape and joined a large group of other freshmen in the time consuming task of rolling peanuts across Portage Avenue using only our noses.
I enjoyed the life at University. All my friends were Jewish. I had still not been exposed to a Gentile milieu. My social life was a challenge to me. I became exposed to girls and went to small parties always in a Jewish home. Some girl began teaching me a few tentative dance steps to the scratch music played on a rickety gramophone. Girls fascinated me not just because they were "different" but because of their sexual attributes.
We were not well into the first full year of the Great Depression. Little by little my father'' bookkeeping income began to shrink and the necessity for economising was a major requirement. Bargains were constantly sought after. A loaf of bread was 5¢. A tin of Brunswick sardines was 4¢. Potatoes, onions, flour and sugar were bought in large quantities and stored in the basement. With 3 children in the house my mother did need help. We usually had a "live in" maid, a (shiksa). Almost always a Ukranian girl sometimes a fresh immigrant girl who didn't speak a work of English. In those days my parents were fluent in Ukranian, which gave my mother ample opportunity to berate at and belittle the poor girl in a language she could understand. The standard wage for foreign domestics in those days was $8.00 per month.
My parents continued to treat me as an adult, Ken and Esther were the "children". When Esther was about 10 she became seriously ill with rheumatic fever which targeted her nervous system. It was caused St. Vitus' Dance because of the constant agitation it produced in children. Her recovery was very slow and many years later as I observed her behaviour I would wonder if the stigmata of this childhood illness did not affect her adult life.
I finally completed the second year of "pre-med" and became eligible for admission to the Manitoba Medical College. The school was adjacent to the Winnipeg General Hospital and William Avenue. The tuition fees were extremely high for those days and several of my school mates who had every intention of pursuing medicine as a career could not enrol because of their inability to finance the fees. My father's solution to the dilemma of financing my career was to sell his holding of stock in International Nickel. He had been caught up in the euphoria of the stock marked preceding the crash of 1929. His last remaining asset was 1000 shares in the nickel company. In 1932 when he was desperately short of funds he sold his shares for $500.00. This was enough to finance my first year. There was tuition, books and a mandatory purchase of a Zeiss microscope.
The enrolment in the first year was open to all who fulfilled the requirements. A quota system for Jews and other undesirables in the Faculty of Medicine had not yet been established. The method used to achieve the same purpose was quite effective. In the first year one third of the class was failed. In the second year, another third was eliminated. Naturally, this "failing" process was highly selective with the Jewish students bearing the brunt of discrimination.
For the first time in my life I became exposed to crude anti-Semitism. The Dean of the Faculty was a psychiatrist called Mathers. Every student was exposed to an interview with the Dean. The Jewish students were subjected to a humiliating interview. Much of it was devoted to the sexual fantasies of the student and his masturbation practices. The interview usually ended with a statement about the student's unfitness for medicine as a career and a strong recommendation to call it quits before it was too late to get a tuition refund.
The Anti-Semitism became more evident after the interview. Jewish students were assigned their own segregated cloakroom. In the anatomy dissecting, laboratory students were assigned cadavers strictly along ethnic origin. Even the few Ukranian students were assigned their "own" cadavers.
In physiology laboratory the same segregation was practised.
My studies were not going well. I was never able to memorize facts without having a thorough understanding. It was particularly important for me to have a visual image of the subject. I managed Biochemistry and physiology by anatomy I found difficult. It remained difficult for me until I learned to visualize the relationship of one structure to another. In order to pass the year it was necessary to have marks at least in the upper 50% of the class. The Jewish student had to perform appreciably better than the Gentile to pass into the second year. I just managed to pass the year. I was satisfied with this and looked forward to the second year.
Financing the year remained a serious problem. A conventional job was totally inobtainable. The only employment I would find was as a news agent on the train. At first I would try selling prepared sandwiches, chocolate bars and soft drinks from Winnipeg to Moose Jaw. Business was very poor and I could barely make ends meet. I had to pay the CPR for a night's lodging in Moose Jaw which left me precious little money for the return trip to Winnipeg. In an effort to improve my lot I switched employers. I left the CPR and began hawking for the CNR on what was then known as a "moonlight" excursion to Grand Beach on the eastern shore of Lake Winnipeg. It was a relatively short run which left Wpg. in the early evening and returned sometime after midnight. The train was fairly full, mostly with young couples in their late teens or early twenties. They weren't interested in spending money on food or soft drink but had a decided interest in sex. I wasn't permitted to roam up and down the aisles hawking "safes or condoms" but I would let it be known that I had a good supply available for sale. I soon did a good business in this commodity. The mark up was very small - perhaps a nickel a condom. In those days to earn $2.00 for a night's work was considered good pay. The season was a short one. The excursions would not begin till July and end the first week-end in September.
Our first year in Medical College diminished the class form about 90 students to 60. The second year was equally demanding when it was whittled down to 40 students. The reason give form the high casualty rate was to allow for the admittance of about a dozen students from the University of Saskatchewan into their year medicine. Apparently some sort of reciprocity arranged had been made by the two provincial universities.
In our second year the Jew "baiting" became very pronounced. Occasionally this baiting became so violent that open warfare erupted. Fortunately we had two protectors. Both were powerful athletes. One was Harry Coleman who I believe is in Ottawa and the other "Tubber" Kabrinsky who tragically lost his life many years ago in a boating accident.
Psychologically the situation became very serious. In 1933 Hitler came on the scene in Germany and his public utterances in the press gave our local Anti-Semites an aura of legitimacy. The pall of depression deepened. R.B. Bennett became the prime minister. His stupid speeches fanned the growing influence of Communists and Socialists.
After completing the second year the entire atmosphere changed. We were rid of the overtly Anti-Semitic teachers and were now into Pathology and clinical subjects. Our pathology professor was the noted author William Boyd. It was truly inspirational to have him as a teacher. For our clinical teachers we had the cream of Winnipeg's medical profession. For the first time I began to relish and enjoy the studies. My marks improved dramatically and I no longer studied with the fear of failure. Before starting our third year I spent several weeks at the main tuberculosis sanitorium at Minette, Manitoba. The chief was a Dr. David Stewart, a noted physician and a truly outstanding administrator. I enjoyed the few weeks there so much that I managed to get accepted for another summer session between the third and fourth years. I continued to do well scholastically in the fourth year but another hazard loomed on the horizon. Where to intern?
Both major teaching hospitals in Winnipeg the Saint Boniface and General had strict Jewish quotas for junior interns. The quota was a magnanimous 2 students at each hospital. My chances of being accepted there was close to zero.
The only other option left in Winnipeg was what was then called a rotating internship. Every two months one changed hospitals. It was a most unpleasant choice and many of my classmates chose to try and intern out of town. One hospital the Regina General had some openings and moreover had the tantalizing offer of a $25.00 per month stipend. My parents financial situation was in dire straits. Not only had my father's income dropped precipitously but the drain of tuition fees and books and a $7.00 allowance a month to me for pocket money brought him almost to the point of bankruptcy. The economic outlook in 1935 was extremely dismal.
In an effort to establish himself in some sort of business to supplement his dwindling income from bookkeeping my father entered into a partnership with a German gentleman called Mr. Maron. The firm was called WORLD TRAVEL BUREAU and their office was on the main floor of the confederation Life Building on Main street almost directly opposite City Hall. An additional firm called MARON &amp; MESBUR also existed in the same premises. I believe its chief function was to facilitate the transfer of money from Winnipeggers to their destitute relatives in Europe. It was a hand to mouth existence but nevertheless a meager income. The German and the Jew got along well together. Their main travel business was booking travellers to Europe on the North German Lloyd steamship line. In those days it had an excellent reputation for service and price. By the time I left Winnipeg there were some serious questions about my father being in business with a National German firm. I believe the partnership lasted about 5 years and on or about 1936 the German consul informed Moran that unless he terminated his partnership with a Jew they would lose the Agency for travel on the North German Lloyd. Fortunately my father had signed the leas on the office. Maron and Mesbur disappeared but father continued a variety of enterprises until well after the onset of the 2nd World War.
I had two months of summer holidays and I was most anxious to get away from Winnipeg. I applied for a summer internship at the Brandon General and my very best friend Alec Lerner also applied. We were accepted. The small staff of doctors were actually quite helpful and gave us as much to do as was permitted. There was a laboratory staffed by one technician. At night and on week-ends we were expected to do the work which consisted almost entirely of a simple urinalysis and a white blood cell count as well as a haemoglobin. There was no blood chemistry nor were there any tests for the various enzymes and proteins. The most complicated test was one called a Basal metabolism. It was a crude breathing apparatus which only confirmed what was obvious to clinical observation. In retrospect it was an important learning experience. For the first time I saw cases of eclampsia, a dreaded complication of pregnancy as well as witnessing the death of a young Greek woman pregnant with her first child. She was beautiful and it was heartbreaking to see her repeated convulsions before she expired. I also witnessed thyroic crises ending in death.
Our duties at the hospital were hard but left ample time for "dating". For the first time in my life I acquired a "girl friend". One of the nurses called Margaret and Alec acquired one too. Also a nurse called Evelyn.
Towards the end of the summer I contracted a very severe cold. It settled in my sinuses and I saw the leading otolaryngeologist in Brandon called McDiarrind. He strongly advised me to have a submucous resection to the septum of my nose. I agreed and he operated on me forthwith under local anaesthetic.
Little did I know what was in store for me. Almost immediately following the surgery I developed a series of complications. First these was a middle ear infection followed by mastoiditis. The mastoidities required surgery under general anaesthetic. My convalescence was slow and I began to have a chronic fever. The hospital administration was very kind. I was given a very nice private room and everyone waited and watched for my recovery. This did not take place. A variety of doctors were consulted and it was decided that I had a fatal disease called lubacuts bacterial endocarditis. Fortunately repeated plantings of my blood on special growths meter to isolate the offending germ all proved negative. In the interval my parents had been summoned from Winnipeg to be with their dying son. By that time the weather had become bitterly cold. The excuse to my parents of staying in Brandon was for more than they could afford. I made up my mind that I had to recuperate in Winnipeg in the relative comfort of home. The doctors in Brandon were glad to be rid of me and the responsibility of caring for me. In the meantime I had the problem of a very late start interning and also the problem of being late to write my final exams both for Manitoba and for the LMCC. The doctors in Brandon gave me the covering letters of my prolonged disability. I was given the option or writing my exams in the fall instead of in the spring.
Little by little my strength returned and I began to study for my final exams with renewed confidence. I not only passed all the exams but passed them with the qualification "with honours". I was very proud of my accomplishment and looked forward to interning in Regina. The hospital was an institution of about 600 beds in those days. We had comfortable intern's quarters and had a rotating schedule which gave us a little experience in all fields. Moreover there was a real pathology department with the resultant higher standards. It was an "approved" hospital for internship which was most important to me.
In November 1936 a delegation from the village of Francis came to the hospital superintendent to recommend to them a young graduate to be the community physician. I haven't the foggiest notion why I was chosen. I was truly frightened with the prospect of starting to practice. I was penniless. All I had for equipment was my stethoscope. Events began to unfold very rapidly. I was guaranteed a minimum monthly stipend of $125.00 plus other incentives to increase my income. The community was predominantly a WASP enclave with a dominant United church, a Masonic temple and two general stores. Naturally there was a post office, a telephone exchange, a Chinese restaurant but most important there was running water and electric power from a real utility. The village was only 39 miles from Regina. We had excellent communication for those days. The highway although a gravel road was considered good. There was a sporadic bus service but most important there were two trains daily to Regina and two trains to return.
The "fringe" incentives were very tempting. I was offered the entire second floor of the Bank of Commerce building on the main street. The floor was subdivided into several rooms. There would be more than enough space for me to have a waiting room for patients, a consulting room as well as an examining room. Then of course there was my "own" living quarter. The adjacent building to the quarters I was to occupy was the pool hall, the barber shop and the living quarters of the proprietor and his wife. The were a young childless couple called Hazel and Alf. They offered me 3 meals daily, plus laundry and housekeeping of my premises for $35.00 a month. The furnishing were all donated to me gratis by the community.
The representative of Ingram and Bell, and instrument and drug company offered to fully equip me for practice. I could repay them in any way I chose from future income. The few drugs available then were also supplied to me to dispense to my patients - all on the same basis of repayment. There was no drug store in the community so I was the dispenser by necessity. The needs were really very simple. There was aspirin of course. Then there were two types of cough syrup - one for adults and one for children. Then there was iron for anaemia and an Oil of Wintergreen rubbing compound for muscular aches and pains. Then there were the usual exotic necessities like Vitamin A &amp; D capsules which were very popular at that time for arthritis and skin disorders. For eczema there was a tar ointment and for infections like impetigo I had a good supply of an amnoriated mercury compound. Considering how few tools doctors had in those days it amazes me today how highly the medical profession was held in those days.
Patients were grateful for what little one could do for them. No one expected a miracle. People appreciated being listened to. Kindness and caring could work wonders. An important part of practice was of course a home visit. I had purchased a 1928 second hand Chevrolet sedan. I paid $300.00 for it with no down payment. I don't recall how much I paid in monthly instalments but I do recall that I had it fully paid for at the end of my first year.
My first winter in practice were nightmarish. My greatest anxiety was the unexpected labour of a woman of whom I knew nothing. I had some very close calls. I was called one night to attend a woman in labour. When I arrived at the farm house the woman was bleeding profusely with no sign of a baby. I realized that she had a placenta praevia. It's a dreaded complication of pregnancy. In those days it was one of the leading causes of maternal death. At this time I must have had a guardian angel looking after me. Shortly after arriving she expelled the placenta first and then a stillborn infant. This dreaded complication is one where the placenta or afterbirth is implanted wrongly at the outlet of the uterus making a normal birth impossible. The patient survived but just barely. It was a harrowing night I spent in that lonely farmhouse. It somehow got around that I had saved the woman's life, which of course didn't hurt my reputation. Then of course there was George Koronkiewicz. George was Polish and was a large landowner and reputedly very well off. Prior to my arrival he had been to see several opthamologists about increasing blindness. None of them could do anything for him so he decided to seek advice at the Mayo Clinic. Shortly after my arrival in Francis he came in to see me with the question "Do You know anything about eyes, doc?" I said "not much" and then asked him what he had come to see me about. He pulled out a vial of murky solution and a piece of paper outlining the injectable dose schedule of this vaccine which had been given him at the Mayo Clinic. I asked him what was the diagnosis made in Rochester. He said he didn't know but had been instructed to have the vaccine administered to him once a week. I said to him that I really didn't like the idea of giving a vaccine without knowing the reason for giving it. "So what do you think I've got, doc?" he asked. I said maybe it's "retrobulbar neuritis". He looked at me somewhat perplexed and said "write it on a piece of paper". He then pulled a piece of paper from his pocket and compared what I had written with what was written on his paper. He was amazed that I had guessed correctly. He became a devoted fan and extolled my brilliance to all who would listen.
The winter of 1937 was a dreadful one for me. Pneumonia was of epidemic proportions. It probably had the characteristics of the deadly ?'flu' epidemic of 1919.
The earliest Air Ambulance in Canada was started by a funeral director in Regina called Speers. People thought he ran it as a public service but in fact it helped him corner the bulk of the funeral business in a large area of southern Saskatchewan. If I had someone desperately ill in winter, I would phone Speers and his pilot would arrive in a little flimsy single prop plane accompanied by a nurse.
He had both skis and wheels. With snow on the field he would use the skis. If the field was bare he would land with wheels. Never did he have an accident. The nurse and he would carry the patient out on a light stretcher and off they'd go. In less than half an hour they'd have the patient in hospital, most of these patients died anyway but I would get credit that everything possible had been done. That first winter I lost 8 patients to pneumonia.
My basic stipend from the community was $125.00 per month but the majority of patients were not members and therefore were expected to pay me something. Most of the time I accepted what was offered. The summer of 1937 was climactically the most dreadful of all pervious summers on the prairie. The heat was unbearable and broke all previous Canadian records. In early July the temperature topped 110°F in many parts of the south. The winds were ferocious with dust storms blackening the sky and blocking roads for days on end. To aggrivate the misery the winds brought in huge hordes of grasshoppers from the States. They were everywhere. The plugged the radiators of cars, they fouled the windshields and appeared in the most unexpected places. The few trees around, the fields and gardens were totally denuded of living plants. It was like a Biblical plague foisted as punishment. John Steinbeck captured the mood of despair in his classic novel The Grapes of Wrath.
As in Arkansas and Oklahoma many Saskatchewan farmers simply picked up their families loaded them onto their trucks and silently stole away on a very long and arduous journey across the prairie and across the mountains for greener pastures. The suffering was dreadful. The animals suffered as well, for lack of fodder, thousands of horses and cattle starved to death. The crops continued to be adequate in Ontario and the railroad offered to ship spare food for free to the prairies. Bags of apples, potatoes and cabbages began to arrive. It was a drop in the bucket but nonetheless much appreciated.
The misery did not subside that fall. An epidemic of equine encepholomyelitis broke out. It seemed as if hardly a family escaped. I became adept at doing spinal taps and would do the cell count on my Zeiss microscope. Fortunately the vast majority of patients survived without any residual aftereffects. There was no treatment which was probably just was well. But there was a vaccine available for horses and the government purchased a large supply and provided it gratis to farmers who were expected to administer it themselves. I was immediately given the status of a veterinarian. I was expected to administer the vaccine intravenously. The only handy veins were in the horses neck. I was truly frightened and so was the horse. A snorting, shaking animal that size makes a city slicker no match. After a few failures I got the hang of it and managed to do it properly, but I never got over my anxieties. I can't recall whether anyone ever paid me for my suffering.
It was amazing to me when my patients ever got the few dollars some would slip me in gratitude. At the end of my first year in Francis I had earned around $4,000.00. This was a considerable sum in those days and I paid off my debt for the car and for my office supplies to Ingram and Bell. I decided then that I would never again purchase anything on credit. And tried always kept my promise.
My education was expanding. I began to do tonsillectomies. It was understood that I would be paid $15 for the operation. And most of the time I actually collected.
During that terrible summer of 1937 someone in the community go

no attempt on my part the keep proper records. It was stretching imagination to the limit to pretend this cottage was a hospital. Although a daily occupancy fee had been agreed to nobody paid the slightest attention to its collection. Even the nurse had trouble collecting her princely salary.
I became progressively more busy. My social life also blossomed. People in Regina became aware of my existence and I would frequently be invited into Regina. There was a good selection of girls in Regina and I enjoyed being invited, but I found it difficult to form any sort of relationship.
I also began to take an interest in my medical colleagues. Weyburn was a good sized town directly south of Francis and even closer than Regina. I became a member of the Weyburn and district Medical Society. Two of my classmates had recently married and started practice in Weyburn. David Bruser and Laurie Rabinowitch were both classmates. A young Kaunle and his bride also settled there. He had graduated a couple of years prior to us. Then there were several older doctors there who more or less dominated the medical society. But dominating our group of private practice doctors was a larger group employed by the Province to care for the two or three thousand mentally ill who were incarcerated in a large facility which dominated the whole community.
Our monthly meetings were held in the institution and I would look forward to these gatherings. It was wonderful to talk shop with my contemporaries and catch up on medical gossip. In spite of my new found friends my loyalty was to Regina. My mentor was the Kravinsky family. Kravinsky was a doctor 20 years older than me and was considered to be an excellent surgeon. I invariably sent my surgical patients to him and would often assist him with the surgery. His wife Bella was a gracious lady and a wonderful hostess. Their daughter Grace was still at school and Ralph their other child was only 11 or 12. They entertained a great deal and were considered to be the pinnacle of Regina Jewish society. Berle's younger sister Ethel had just been married to Eddie Bosin and they became my life long best friends. Within a year of starting practice I had accumulated enough savings to buy a new car. I chose a 1937 Chevrolet Sedan. It's price was around 6 or 700 dollars. Using the 1929 Chevrolet as a "trade in" I don't think I paid more than $400 or 450 for this vehicle. I was very proud of it and enjoyed making house calls with it. At the pump gasoline cost 20¢ a gallon but I was told to buy bulk gas as it was much cheaper that way. I rented a very large metal barrel which was lined up with many others on a high platform. At the bottom was a tap which could be locked when not in use. A hose was used to fill the car tank. The do it yourself gas dispensary brought the cost of gasoline to about 10 cents a gallon.
Owning a new car made me very anxious to go on a trip. My mother insisted that if I thought of a trip it would have to be to New York. My uncle Sam and his wife Rose as well as a widowed sister of my uncle Mottia in New York were included. With the luggage on board there was hardly room to breathe. Nobody complained except my Aunt Rose who suffered terribly with her haemorrhoids.
We started our trip to New York on May 4th 1938. It was remarkably uneventful. We stopped in Chicago for a few days to visit with some relatives. It was a good break in the journey. We stayed with these relatives who were excellent hosts.
In New York we were packed into the Schwartzman apartment like sardines in a can. I remember New York vividly mostly because of the entertainments. Every night was a new experience. I squired my cousin Esther to see Eddie Cantor in Whoopee. We went to Billy Rose's night club called Casa Manana and danced to Duke Ellington and his band. Then there was a night at the Copacabana night club when we saw Cab Calloway and the young and gorgeous Lena Horne. The trip lasted about 3 weeks and I felt refreshed and rejuvinated. I had arranged for a locum teneus with a Dr. Parent from the neighbouring village of Spradley. I don't recall the financial arrangements I made with him but I was satisfied with the arrangement and he too was satisfied because he became my standby as time went on.
One night in February 1939 I awoke from a sound sleep with a dull stomach ache. I examined my abdomen as well as I could and sure enough I was moderately tender in the right lower side. Did I or did I not have appendicitis? I decided forthwith to go into Regina and see Kravinsky. He admitted me as a patient of the Regina General Hospital and that same day I suffered an appendectomy. In 1938 surgical patients were kept in bed. I was prescribed morphine for pain. This was my first experience with morphine. I became intensely nauseated and vomited incessantly. It was my first experience with morphine and my last.
To make matters worse I couldn't void and had to be catheterized repeatedly. The Kravinskys kindly offered to keep me for a few days of leisurely convalescence. When I finally returned to Francis I was hardly robust.
That spring of 1939 following this appendectomy, I decided to return to Winnipeg for a proper holiday. I hadn't seen my parents or my sister Esther and brother Ken for about a year and I enjoyed seeing them all. Particularly my mother's cooking which I sorely missed.
My "third" cousin Esther Portigal decided to have a party. By this time she was already married to Eddie Cohen but still living with her parents. I had no idea that she ad an ulterior motive in having a party, the motive was to bring Freda Civkin and me together. Freda was three years younger than me. She was very pretty and had a reputation as a brilliant student. Freda had been keeping company with a young engineer called Eddie Churchill. For reasons unknown to me the relationship had been terminated and Freda was a free agent as was I.
During the few days remaining of my holiday I saw her constantly. I was truly smitten.
When I returned to Francis I became busier than ever but wrote to Freda almost daily. I decided to return to Winnipeg in May and ask her to marry me. I was ecstatic when she agreed.
There was much to be done. -

I must pause and digress for a moment. A completely new aspect and direction to my life had started. For years I have admired the gifted writer of fiction. How skilfully they developed a story and their ability to use words and sentences to express emotion and action. The serious articles particularly those in the Atlantic Monthly or the lead commentary in the New Yorker are beautifully crafted. I've often wondered where one learns the skills. Is it by taking a course in creative writing at some college? This road does not appeal to me. Perhaps it's because I'm too old. If I did take a course or classes would I have anything worthwhile to write about?
I've glanced over the pages I've written and find them dull and tedious. Other than my immediate family, who might find parts of it amusing (in a patronizing way) I can think of no one else. Perhaps the exercise is good for me. It has given me a chance to stir my memory in reflecting on my life.
At my age one does not do much future planning. Before the past fades into oblivion I started this exercise in recollection. On reading some of the pages I've written so far I'm struck by the skimpiness of my notes. I seem to have made no effort to elaborate on the events which took place.

Now to return to 1939. In those days I seemed to have had enormous sources of energy. I would see patients in Francis and when the last one had gone I would get into the car and drive all night to Winnipeg. The week end would start on Friday night when I had seen the last patient. The roads in those days were almost all entirely gravel. It was impossible to drive much faster than about 40 miles an hour. On a particularly good stretch maybe 50 miles an hour could be achieved. I had decided on getting a new car. This time I was struck with the appearance of the 1939 Nova and bought the sedan, the one extravagance I indulged in was to order the snow drift saver tires. I think they were called that but I was probably wrong. These salient tires had a miniature tire inside the outer casing. In the event of a blowout the inner tire would remain inflated and keep your safely in control until the car came to a full stop. On a straight stretch of road, particularly on pavement I could easily reach 90 or 100 miles an hour.
Now to return to the week end routine. After having supper at about 6 or 6:30, I would get into the car, drive all night and arrive in Winnipeg when dawn was breaking. My dates with Freda were pre-arranged and on Sunday night I would start my long drive back to Francis. Patients would often be waiting for me on Monday morning. The time left for sleeping was almost non existent.
There was an interesting blending of events when Freda and I decided to inform our parents of our engagement. The young King and Queen of England were paying their first official visit to Canada. Their open limousine was to drive down Main Street in front of my father's office which was on the main floor of the Confederation Life building directly across the street from the City Hall. It was practically a front row seat. Freda and I chose that day to inform our respective parents. My father was non committal at the news but my mother's nose became strictly out of joint. How could I insult her by not consulting her of my decision.
The next day I drove back to Francis and Freda paid her a visit to meet the family and pay her respects. It was not until we were married that I heard of my mother's rudeness to her. Apparently the daughter of a common barber was an unsuitable match for her son the doctor. This was only one of a multitude of sins of which we were both guilty. I had met the Civkins when calling for Freda and I have no recollection how they reacted to our engagement.
It is hard to visualize our relative poverty in 1939. Freda's main occupation was teaching piano. She taught in pupils' homes all over the city. Her only means of transportation was the street car. It was time consuming and the fees per lesson were by present day standards laughable. The finances for a presentable wedding were almost non existent. Coming to the rescue was Freda's relatively prosperous uncle Sam Pearlman. Sam was the publisher of a racing sheet. It may have been called the Sporting news. He and his wife Yetta offered to finance the wedding at the Royal Alexandra Hotel. It was to be held on Sunday August 13th. Rabbi Kahanovitch the dean of the rabbinical community in western Canada was to officiate. I can't recall who the bridesmaids were but Freda did have a lovely new wedding gown. The music was on the piano. I work a brand new white double breasted suit. The luncheon was a fish meal. There was wine and the usual sweet table. My best man was Alec Lerner who came in specially from his practice in Alsask, Saskatchewan. The guest list totalled well in excess of 100 or 125 guests. It was a happy affair and we planned to leave immediately after the affair. The day was blistering hot. That week in August was setting records for heat. Air conditioning other than in the odd movie house was non existent. Certainly an air conditioned car was unknown. As we were leaving the hotel we were showered with confetti. Some of Freda's well wishers shoved handfuls of confetti inside her going away outfit. The dreadful heat in the car and the resultant perspiration made the dye in the confetti run. She had multicoloured dye on her face, neck and chest. When we were safely out of town I drew off the road and stopped the car while Freda took off almost all her clothes. This was how we drove on past he US border and on to Grand Forks North Dakota. Our plant was to drive all the way down to San Francisco where a World's Fair was in progress. The further south and west we drove the more oppressive the heat became. In Pierre, South Dakota the temperature at midnight was 104°F and the mountain roads through Wyoming and Utah provided little or no relief from the heat. It was particularly hot driving through the Great Salt Desert.
Soon we were in Nevada. In a town called Elko I developed an abscessed wisdom tooth. We found an obliging dentist who extracted it for the princely fee of $2.00.
By Canadian prairie standards, Elko, Nevada was not a hamlet. It was closer in size to small towns like Melville. To our amazement the best hotel in town boasted chamber pots in the rooms and wash basins were filled with water in pitchers.
We wasted no time in leaving Elko and drove on to what was locally called the biggest little city in the world - Reno, Nevada. This was long before Las Vegas come on the scene. Reno was not only a mecca for gamblers but was the undisputed capital for quickie marriages and divorces. The place we enjoyed the most in Nevada was Lake Tahoe. We found it enchanting. We were finally on the last leg of our trip to San Francisco. Again we were met by a wall of intense heat particularly the Bay area in late evening and were amazed at the sudden change in climate. Leaving the furnace like heat of the valleys to the refreshing coolness of San Francisco was an unforgettable experience. We were total strangers in a big city arriving fairly late at night. We were hungry and had no shelter. As we drove down a street not knowing where we were, we spied a policeman. The officer was extraordinarily polite and helpful. First of all he directed us to a small Italian restaurant to satisfy our hunger and then to a hotel where we could have the amenities of civilization. The Italian restaurant where we headed to first was an extraordinary little place. The service was cafeteria style. For 50 cents you could have lamb or beef or chicken - in any quantity - with pasta and vegetables and tea or coffee. The food was marvellous and after more than 52 years has left an indelible recollection, and so did our hotel room - which had all the conveniences one could possibly expect. And San Francisco was deliciously cool after the blistering heat of travelling there - the hotel room rate was $2.00 per day.
I will digress for a moment to write of our finances. We planned to be away for exactly 3 weeks. 1939 was long before the advent of credit cards. Cheques for daily transactions were looked upon with suspicion and were very impractical. We budgeted for almost $25.00 per day with was thought to be a very considerable sum at the time. This of course included the cost of driving the car.
When we were settled down in San Francisco our attention turned to the World's Fair. The fair was wonderful. I vividly recall the night club where Sally Ruud performed. Sally Ruud was the most notorious of the naked fan dancers. She was very good but I couldn't help noticing that she shaved her pubic hair. At another night we watched Phil Harris and his wife Alice Faye perform. The highlight came when Phil Harris made a public comment about how pretty Freda looked. On another evening we danced to Eddie Duchin and his orchestra. He was a very gifted pianist and musician. He died not long after from a brain tumour.
Our honeymoon was cut short by events we didn't anticipate. We were in a night club and had just finished dining at about 2 AM when a trembling waiter came to our table to hand us an "EXTRA" newspaper just off the press. Huge black headlines declared Hitler invades Poland.
There and then we decided to return home as quickly as possible. We had a radio in the car and heard when Britain and France declared war and a day or two later when Canada joined the war.
We had one mishap on our return journey. One of our tires blew in the intense heat of the desert. Our finances were becoming somewhat depleted as I hadn't budgeted for a tire replacement. In any event we arrived in Regina with only a couple of dollars to spare. But that was enough for the hotel and several meals.
Prior to our wedding I had rented a two storey house adjacent to the United church. It was a conventional house with a living room, dining room, kitchen and a summer kitchen on the main floor and 3 bedrooms on the second floor. In the basement was a hot air furnace. I found a retired farmer who had a reputation as a painter and paperhanger. I had the whole house decorated. Supervising the decorating during our absence was Isaac Stoffman, Freda's first cousin who had just graduated and was happy to oblige us by being my locum teneus.
Freda liked what she saw which relieved me greatly. We settled down into domestic life very quickly. My friends in Regina and Weyburn had us over and before long we were entertaining them at parties in our own house. We were also fortunate in that the fall of 1939 was unusually mild in our part of Saskatchewan with no sign of snow until the last week of December. As 1940 progressed with little or no action in Europe many of us began to worry that Hitler was going to get away with his aggression. The Blitzkrieg in Europe was a tremendous shock to us and when the Battle of Britain got underway I decided to enlist in the army. I was told to stay where I was and was told that I would be called when necessary. To me as to most of my contemporaries Hitler was evil incarnate. Instinctively we were angry at Germany for aiding and abetting his vicious "theories", his virulent and violent anti-Semitism and his stated aim to dominate Europe and create a huge class of slaves to serve the Master Race.
The Battle of Britain unfolded on our radios like a fairy tale. It became almost Biblical in its scope with David conquering the giant Goliath.
I anticipated being called up and decided on moving to Regina. I was becoming very busy in my practice. Because some of my neighbouring doctors were already in service I was asked to be available for service. The villages of Lajourd and Riceton offered me consulting rooms twice a week to see their patients. It was as easy to serve these communities from Regina as from Francis which was an important factor in us deciding to move to a city. The only drawback was that I was denied admitting privileges in the two major Regina hospitals. The respective staffs had voted to freeze out all newcomers for the duration of the war. This was a nuisance to me and an inconvenience rather than a major setback.
We managed to rent a small cottage at 3316 Victoria Ave. Our rent was $40.00 per month which we thought was pure extortion. We had hoped to be able to rent an apartment but were turned down in two separate apartment buildings for no other reason that that we were Jewish. This was overt Anti-Semitism by the local WASP establishment.
We moved into our rented cottage in 1941 and later that year the army informed me to prepare for an imminent "call up". This pending "call up" coincided with Freda's pregnancy. We expected our baby in April 1942 and the previous month in March I had already spent 3 weeks in Camp Borden near Barrie, Ontario for my start of army basic training. Needless to say I hated it. By the time I returned to Regina spring had arrived and Alex was born on April 14th 1942. Freda nursed the baby but in spite of all outward signs of health the baby cried incessantly. In retrospect the child was probably intolerant of cows' milk but this was long before the advent of milk substitutes. Our paediatrician was a Dr. Gareau who assured us that the baby was fine. The head nurse in the paediatric ward at the General Hospital was well acquainted with our problem. Her name was Miss Jolly and she and Gareau insisted that if only we'd leave Alex in their care they'd straighten him out in a week or ten days. Both of us jumped at the chance of having a bit of rest and we agreed to leave the baby in their care. In retrospect our callous behaviour would have been unthinkable at present. Nevertheless we jumped at this opportunity and spent a beautiful holiday in Banff and Lake Louise. On our return the baby continued to cry incessantly.
My army duties were minimal. I was made the medical officer for a Mobile Recruitment Centre. The staff consisted of myself, a clerk, a driver and a sergeant. The sergeant would arrange the itinerary. Posters advising the community of the date of our arrival, the location of the recruitment centre and bookings for an overnight stand in a hotel if the distance from Regina was too far to return late in the afternoon - I was always amazed at the brisk "business" our recruitment centres generated. The clerk did most of the work. He would fill out the application forms, medical history, and measure and weigh the recruit. I would complete the medical form. The two trips I most clearly recall was one to the village of Gravelbourg in the south west. It was a French Canadian community. It was dominated by a pretty church with beautifully religious murals and the campus of a parochial Junior college. The village itself was very well maintained and was much more impressive than other villages of a similar size in other parts of Southern Saskatchewan. The other village I recall even more vividly. It was Arcala in the south East. The hotel we were booked into was very well maintained. My room was immaculately clean and it boasted of a fine dining room and beer parlour. The waitress in the dining room recommended the ham steak as being outstanding. I recall enjoying the meal and afterward joining my "staff" in the beer parlour. My experience with beer was negligible but it was recommended. I have a bottle of Guinness stout. I went to bed at a reasonable hour but I awoke in the middle of the night with a terrible itch. Bedbugs was the first diagnosis to come to mind. I got out of bed turned on the lights to see myself in the mirror. At a glance I knew it was not bed bugs but hives. It was either the ham steak or the stout or a combination of both. I decided to take a bath to relax my body and eventually fell asleep again.
By morning the itch had subsided and by the time I was back home I was completely recovered.
Life was relatively pleasant. My army duties were minimal and being lulled into a false sense of security I traded my Nova car for a very upscale Pontiac sedan. No sooner did I settle into a life of domesticity when a bomb shell descended. Alex was now a year old and was turning into a beautiful child. With the Americans on our side the war did not seem so hopeless. The Battle of Britain had been won and the Russians were holding the Nazis - even though the enemy had almost reached to Volga. Leningrad and Moscow were in Russian hands and the Germans were paying a terrible price for their senseless aggression.
Life in Regina was becoming quite interesting. We were in the midst of a real social explosion. Cocktail parties, dances and innumerable gatherings. In May 1942 our placid and pleasant life was suddenly disrupted. The medical brigadier in charge of all medical services in the Province phoned me. It was not until much later that I discovered that he was a notorious Anti-Semite and an inveterate liar.
His message was clear and simple - pack up and get to Prince Albert in 48 hours. We had a house in Regina, furniture and most important of all a small baby. By a stroke of luck the medical officer I was to report to was Mitchell Rubin a classmate and a Jew. I immediately phoned Mitch and told him what had happened. He already knew what took place and promised to find us a place to live. News of our transfer travelled fast and we were swamped with offers to sublet our furnished dwelling.
As ordered we arrived in Prince Albert within 48 hours and miraculously Mitch did find a tiny basement apartment. Mitch had enlisted the week the war erupted in September 1939. He was shipped immediately to Britain where he served in a variety of units. In 1941 he became very ill with a severe kidney disorder and apparently almost died. Eventually he was invalided back to Canada where he made a slow recovery. He was now promoted to major and was given the job of running the medical establishment in Prince Albert. He was a native of Saskatchewan and had been brought up in a small village in the province. After graduation he began practice in a village close to his family's home. He married a nurse a fine Gentile girl. Apparently they had no children. No sooner did we settle foot in Prince Albert when our Brigadier showed up. He was very cordial and hoped that I would have a pleasant summer in P.A. Of course the bastard was lying. He had already submitted my name for overseas duty.
Freda managed the constant disruption with equanimity and remarkable good humour. Even the baby was standing by himself and was gradually developing into a beautiful little boy.
My work in P.A. was really quite simple. There were new recruits to examine as well as taking "sick parade" at the notorious Prince Albert Penitentiary. The weather was glorious and we had already met some Jewish families. It was probably during this short interval the Freda became pregnant for the second time.
Finally the hammer fell. I was informed that I had exactly 14 days to get to Windsor Nova Scotia. The bastard general lied to me with malice when he wished me a lovely placid summer at the entrance to Prince Albert National Park. For it was he who placed my name at the top of the list for shipment to Britain. We plunged into a frenzy of activity. We had previously decided that should I be sent to Europe Freda and the children would move to Winnipeg and move into the upstairs apartment in Civkin's house on College Ave. It was a self contained suite with its own private entrance, a living room, bedroom, kitchen and bathroom. It was presently occupied by a tenant but the terms were that the tenant was obliged to vacate the premises on 2 weeks notice. Our possessions were to be shipped from Regina where they were still in our little cottage on Victoria. There was a fine sofa and chair, a Chinese rug, a Heintzman piano and other miscellany accumulated in almost 3 years of marriage. How we managed to do it all in so short a time was amazing. Only one bad error of judgement occurred. I had bought a new Pontiac sedan during the winter. It was in immaculate condition and when I returned to the dealer who sold it to me he offered to purchase it for ½ of what I had paid him for it. I knew he was taking advantage of me, but I had no time to advertise and sell it privately.
When I returned from overseas in 1946 and needed a car the stupid salesman a Mr. Higgins; the grandfather of Dick Grosch one of Alex' best friends, boasted to me about the bargain he had bought from me and how he had sold it a year later for 4 times what he had paid me.
We got to our destination in Windsor Nova Scotia exactly on time and learned that the date of sailing was as yet unknown. It was May 1943 and the Annapolis valley was ablaze in apple tree blossoms. The town was pretty and the climate delightful. We were soon a group of young married couples most of us Captains in the Royal Cdn. Med. Corps. By this time both Freda and I were pretty certain of the pregnancy. When I would see the child was not discussed. This was not a topic which either of us spoke of.
And so came to a pause a chapter in our lives. We were embarking on the unknown. Freda with a baby in tow and an unborn child, left to manage as best she could. At least she would not be alone. In Winnipeg she would have her parents as well as mine. As for her finances she would probably manage. I assigned almost all my army pay to her. After paying rent to her parents and paying her light bill she would have in excess of $100.00 per month for day to day expenses. This was not an insignificant sum at that time for it was sufficient to pay for domestic help which she particularly needed after David was born on February 1st, 1944.
Finally we sailed. The troop ship was the Empress of Japan now renamed the Empress of Scotland. We crossed the Atlantic without a convoy or escort, relying entirely on the ship's speed to avoid interruption by German "U" boats.
The crossing was very rough, most of the time I had to lie in my bunk. At no time did I show any signs of tolerance to sea sickness. My only relief was when I managed to doze or sleep. Perhaps had there been available some the motion sickness remedies still to be invented I might have tolerated the voyage better.
Eventually we entered the Irish Sea and headed for the Scottish coast. The sea became much calmer and I was able to join the hordes of soldiers crowding the deck to watch the panorama of Ireland, Scotland and finally England and the docks of Liverpool.
None of us knew where we were. The crew denied all knowledge of our destination. In those days silence and secrecy were paramount.
When we disembarked and were shepherded onto a troop train heading south did I realize that I was now in a real warzone.

It's now 1992 and almost a half century since the events I've tried to recollect. Perhaps it's time to pause and reflect. In a few months I'll be 80 years old. Before I retired from practice six years ago I'd consider patients my age as very old and requiring special care and attention. In spite of my present infirmities I don't feel quite that ancient or decrepit.
For the past few months my bother Ken has developed a keen interest in our family's genealogy. He has written me several times about dates of birth and death of various members of our family. He his keeping track of all this on his computer and printer which is a new toy he has recently acquired. About a week ago Toots uncovered a letter dated 1980 from a cousin - (several times removed) - in Chicago. It was from Paula Gordon. She is a woman my age also born in Uman and emigrated to Chicago in 1920 or 1921. Her maiden name was DRUBYGH. In brief this is what I learned from her long and disjointed letter. On our maternal grandfather's side we are descended from a man called AKIBA SHKODNIK who lived in a village close to UMAN. On or about 1800 he acquired a wife called RISSEL. They had 3 daughters. One daughter named one of her sons after the grandfather AKIBA. Another daughter married a Schwartzman. Another daughter married a Freivoch (my mother's maiden name). Each of these "new" branches had males called AKIBA. The Freivoch Akiba was my grandfather. Your uncle Ken is named for him as is Esther Young's brother Ken Schwartzman in New York. Freda Metter whom I believe you know was a Schwartzman. Another daughter (several generations ago married a DRUBYCH) and so on. Now we can trace our family tree - one branch at least 200 years. The occupations of these long forgotten ancestors I don't know.
I must not forget the Brodetzkys. The Brodetzkys also belonged on the family tree. Your grandmother Brushka always considered them her close relations. Mrs. Drubych Paula Gordon's mother was a Brodetzky. There was a urologist in Winnipeg called Dr. John Brodie. He married a Gentile lady and completely severed all ties with his relations and with the Jewish community. Mrs. Drubych had a very distinguished brother Dr. Zelig Brodetzky - Professor of Mathematics at Leeds University. He eventually became the President of the Board of Jewish Deputies in England. He was a close friend of Chaim Weizmaun. And eventually became the President of the Hebrew University in Jerusalem. Another member of the family I should mention is my childhood friend and cousin Grisha Freivoch or Frivei. Grisha's father was Mayer who was my mother's uncle - a brother to my grandfather Akiba.
Grisha was an only child. His parents emigrated to Paris instead of America. When war in Europe erupted in 1939 they fled to Lima, Peru. About 15 years ago they settled in Los Angeles. Now Grisha and his family are back in Paris. Esther Young saw them in Lima Peru many years ago. She was very impressed. They are apparently a highly cultivated family.
The preceding has been a very sketch account of our family. I have precious little knowledge of Freda's family. Except for the fact that Celia Civkin was a Pearlman. There were four Pearlman sisters Zelda Stoffman, Rasha, Golden and one sister who was mentally retarded. Then there were 2 brothers Sam and Sidney. Sam became a protégé of Walter Aurenberg the mover of an important publishing empire and Sam the publisher of the New York based Triangle publications. Solomon Civkin was a character worthy of description by the important Yiddish writers of the time.
Both Celia and Solomon Civkin were ardent Yiddishists. They spoke to each other in Yiddish only and wrote to their children in Yiddish. They were radical intellectuals both steeped in the socialist tradition of the early twentieth century. Civkin was a socialist in the anarchic tradition and Celia was a confirmed communist always justifying Stalin's brutalities. They quarrelled incessantly but listening to their quarrels was an educational experience. They had four children. The eldest Alex died at age 12 from lobar pneumonia. Then came Freda, Sidney followed by eleven months and finally Naomi. Sidney an otolaryngologist in Vancouver and Naomi a gifted concert pianist, who lives in California. Sidney married Estelle Mindess of Winnipeg. They have two daughters Linda and Shelley.
Naomi married Bernie Zaslav of New York. Bernie is a gifted violist who at one time played with the Cleveland Orchestra under George Szell. In recent years he has concertized extensively usually with well known string quartets. They have two married children, Mark and Claudia.
My sister Esther married Sam Wolinsky later known as Wallen. They were married in 1942. Sam had recently enlisted in the RCAF. Sam's father Joseph Wolinsky was reputed to be one of the richest Jews in Winnipeg. He was involved in a multitude of business and his sons become active in some of the enterprises. One of the sons Leonard, founded an electrical manufacturing business in Toronto. Sam became a junior partner and when the business was sold to a large American Corporation he became instantly very wealthy. Esther and Sam had 3 children Richard the oldest was born in 1949 followed by Shelagh and Mina.
My "kid" brother Ken was born in 1928. He was only 7 years old when I left home.
I will write more of my family later. I must return to a more orderly recitation of the biographical events of my long life.

And now to return to the chronological events until I digressed.
The British countryside is vividly green and lush in May and June. The war did not disrupt the beauty of the flowers, the trees or the picture postcard appearance of the villages. We finally arrived at our destination in Aldershot. This was a town well known as the site for military training. The barracks housed the thousands of troops assembled to learn the fundamentals of soldiering. I hated the place from the start but did look forward to our free "weekends". We required billeting passes from the army and once secured all we needed was to hop on a train (where were very frequent and always on time). A few days after arriving in Aldershot I was introduced to my first glimpse of London from afar. London was still in the midst of the fire bombing and Battle of Britain. I don't think these descriptive terms had been invented. They were very apt at night particularly if the sky was overcast one could see the reflection of the fire bombing and the bursts of anti-aircraft fire which lit the sky at the horizon. It was an awesome sight but strangely it did not produce any sensation of fear. This was at the height of the London blitz but all of us were quite oblivious and ignorant of its historical significance.
At the first week-end opportunity I secured a billeting pass and off I rode to London. There I was joined by a couple of acquaintances from Winnipeg. We wandered the streets till dark. In June and early July nightfall comes very late. Nevertheless we were fascinated at the teeming life around us. The blackout was total. Taxis were permitted one very dim and hooded light at night. Even lighting a cigarette without shielding the flame was forbidden. Nevertheless life proceeded as usual. My first exposure to the horrible destruction of war was going down to the London underground. The long passageways and corridors were lined with double decker street cars for those whose homes had been bombed. It was a nerve wracking experience to see whole families trying to get some rest under appalling conditions. For my first night in London I was billeted in a very fancy hotel called the Park Lane on Piccadilly. The room was spacious and overlooked Green Park. I fell asleep in the most comfortable bed I had been in for many months. Sometime during the night I was suddenly awakened by the most horrendous explosions. The window rattled as did the chandelier in the middle of the ceiling. One didn't need any light to see what was going on outside. I was witnessing my first air raid and the deafening noise was coming from the anti-aircraft batteries across the street in Green Park. Needless to say, I was thoroughly frightened by this - my first wartime experience with the reality of war.
When daybreak came the bombardment petered out. I then noticed the dirigibles encircling the park all of them dangling long metal chains. The chains were apparently designed to entangle enemy aircraft should they attempt a low level bombing run. I thought this experience exciting and now considered myself part of the war effort.
During the weeks which followed in Aldershot my experience of war-time Britain grew considerably. For the first time I saw a propellorless aircraft in the sky. I can't recall whether the term jet had been coined at that time.
The month of June 1943 was the time when mass bombings of Germany commenced. Most afternoons many of us would stay outdoors and try to count the waves of massed bombers flying in formations eastwards towards the Continent. Some hours later we would count them as they returned from their bombing mission. Sometimes we would see planes in obvious distress such as smoking engines.
I finally managed to contact my good friend Alec Lerner. All I knew at that time that he was a medical officer with the Calgary Highlanders. I had heard that he had recently married into a well to do family but little else. He invited me to spend a week-end at his in-laws country home at Surningdale not far from Aldershot. He would meet me with a vehicle at the station and drive me to the house.
When we met at the station, I noticed a perceptible change in my friend. First of all his speech bore a slight trace of English accent and his manner somewhat superior and paternalistic.
Little by little I learned that he had married the daughter of Simon Marks the head of one of the world's great mercantile dynasties - Marks &amp; Spencer stores. Hannah his wife was a spirited young woman and I thought quite likeable. They already had a child - a boy roughly the same age as Alex.
The country home was a sprawling estate. This was my first introduction to such a magnificent estate.
As I entered the house I was struck by the spaciousness and scale of the interior. The entry hall - if one could call it that was a huge room with the opposite end opening onto a glorious garden. This whole wall was glazed in an interesting pattern as were the huge doors leading to the garden. To the left as you entered was a broad curved staircase leading to the upper floor. Behind the staircase were the doors to the dining room. On the right were two doors. The first to a huge drawing room which apparently was not used. The walls were decorated with French impressionist paintings. I had never seen such art in my life. The second door on the right led to another small drawing room with books, sofas and prominently displayed was a magnificent young girl's portrait glowing with the rosiness that immediately identified it as a Renoir.
The bedroom I was assigned was in the "guest house". The room was decorated with Degas sketches and the bed sheets were satin. "My" bathroom was as big as an average Canadian bedroom maybe larger.
Alec took me on a tour of the grounds. There were tennis courts and a house especially designed to accommodate a small fleet of limousines and sportcars. All of these vehicles were upon blocks and were not used because of the war. I used the term house instead of garage because by no stretch of imagination could it be equated with a building we would call a garage in Canada.
After the war the Markses became elevated to Sir Simon and Lady marks but when I knew them they were still Mr. and Mrs. They were both unpretentious and very well informal. Both of them spent only weekends in the country. They had vacated their home in London but had an apartment at the Dorchester Hotel in London.
I became a frequent visitor on week ends at Sureningdale and although I must have appeared as a gawking colonial to Mr. and Mrs. Marks as well as to the household staff.
There was one quite memorable occasion which has stuck with me. It was in November or December of 1943. Had I know about it before hand I'd probably have "chickened out" and made some lame excuse. I don't recall the whole guest list except for 3 particular guests. There was a Lord and Lady ______ he being the resident or chairman of Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI). One of the great industries vital to the war effort. I had read somewhere the ICI was related to the great German chemical complexes. Knowledge of the poison gases used to kill millions in the German concentration camps was as yet unknown. On my right sat another Lord &amp; Lady. This one being the chairman of the London transit complexes such as the underground and buses and so on. This poor Lord was wheezing very badly with asthma. He asked me what I did in the Army and when I told him I was a doctor he wanted to know if I had any knowledge of new drugs in the treatment of asthma. On my left sat a woman called Lady Middleton. I had recently read that she was a sister of the notorious Fascist leader of the English Nazi Oswald Moseley. Fortunately he was imprisoned when war erupted. I felt most uncomfortable at my proximity to the sister of a man espousing every vicious anti-Semitic utterance mouthed by his mentor Adolph Hitler. I couldn't wait for dinner to conclude so that I could question Alec about Lady Middleton. His only comment was that everybody knew she was a Moseley. The Moseleys were a very old and distinguished English family and one couldn't blame her for her brother's beliefs.
This comment didn't sit too well with me. I couldn't reconcile the fact that a very prominent Jewish family was on such intimate terms with upper crust English aristocracy many of whom were originally quite sympathetic to the aspirations of the Hitler regime.
Strangely, Simon Marks was a staunch supporter of Jewish aspirations and a large variety of Jewish causes.
Mrs. Marks was born a Sieff - one of the oldest and most prominent Jewish families in England. She too was a leading figure in Jewish philanthropy.
Army life in England was a rather lazy and boring existence. I continued to be posted to medical examination groups in the London environs.
The news from "home" was good. I would write to Freda at least 3 - 4 times weekly and she would reply almost as frequently. Her pregnancy was progressing well. Alex was developing rapidly and had learned a few words. My "army" portrait in the living room encouraged Alex to identify all men dress in uniform as "Daddy". Whenever Freda took him outdoors either for a walk or shopping he would amuse pedestrians by pointing to every uniformed man as "Daddy".
After New Year's Day 1944 I was posted to a very small medical unit headed by Charles Hollenberg from Winnipeg. He was an orthopaedic surgeon and had been promoted to major. We got along quite will.
On February 2nd 1944 I received a cable telling me that Freda had given birth to another son on February 1st. I didn't know the details except that the cable said "Mother and child doing well". Letters detailing Freda's sudden onset of labour and the mad dash to the hospital by taxi were later vividly described. Fortunately she had been able to secure domestic help which in wartime was an achievement. We had decided on calling the baby DAVID.
One day in April Charlie Hollenberg my C.O. talked to me about my future. He told me I had two choices. The first choice was that I remain with the unit. He expected to be transferred shortly and would recommend that I succeed him thereby gaining a promotion to major. The second choice was a posting to #10 Canadian General Hospital. The hospital which originated in London Ontario had an excellent reputation with its chiefs of department being almost entirely drawn from the staff of the Medical Faculty at the University of Western Ontario. It didn't take me long to decide. I chose the hospital.
The transfer was almost immediate. I was to report to the hospital at once and was faced with a long journey by train to a point called Scotch Corner in Yorkshire. I shall never forget that trip. I had a heavy Army issue packsack crammed with my belongings and which weighed about 75 lbs. The train was packed with soldiers not just the seats but the narrow corridors as well. The train left our station sometime in the afternoon. I stood in the train corridor partly supported by other soldiers. There was no way to relieve one's bladder or get a drink of water. The so called journey took 12 solid hours. I seemed half paralyzed when I got off at the station in Scotch Corner. There were several army vehicles at the station to give me a lift to the hospital. It was about 4 AM and already the sun had risen. When I entered the building no one was around all were sound asleep. I lay down on the floor with the knapsack as my pillow and immediately fell asleep from utter exhaustion.
It didn't take me long to adjust to my new life. The hospital had been vacated from all patients. We were to get ready for new adventures - which to us meant only one thing. Somehow we would participate in the invasion of Europe. Naturally we didn't know where or when.
On about June 1 we began to pack for an impending journey. We were sorry to leave Scotch corner. The countryside was beautiful. It was truly picture postcard country and the weather was glorious. We boarded a train which took to us to a sea side town called HOVE - adjacent to Brighton on the English Channel. All day long were watched unending convoys of tanks, other mobile arms, vehicles packed with soldiers. The blackout was total and everyone observed the control of idle speculation outside the confines of our building.
The building it was housed in faced the sea and my room had a wonderful view of the beach and channel. The beach was strewn with small rocks and was almost always totally deserted. The ocean breakers made a constant rhythmic pounding which some found annoying while most of us found its monotony soothing.
Life was boring but most of us did manage to take the bus into Brighton or Eastbourne - all well known as English summer resort towns.
Once I recall going to Portsmouth where we had a chance to see Nelson's famous ship the Victory. A spot on deck is marked where he was fatally shot. This "flagship" of his fleet is amazingly small. Below deck it was impossible to stand erect. No matter where one turned you had to stoop to avoid banging one's head. It was interesting to speculate on the stench below deck of the packed, sweaty unwashed bodies.
Slowly the days slipped by. June 6, 1944 was quite breezy with a choppy sea but blue sky with scattered fluffy clouds. Soon came waves of bombers and fighter planes. The placidity of the previous weeks was gone. The invasion of Europe had begun and excitement and restlessness filled the day.
In spite of being only a "stone's throw" across the channel where the action was. The news of the action on the French coast was amazingly meagre. With each successive day we knew our turn would soon arrive. The "official" bulletins were always upbeat but we well knew to take these with a large dose of salt.
Our turn finally arrived in the last week of June. We were ready to go.. We were divided into small groups. Each group sailed on a special landing craft. It was daybreak when we approached the coast. The tide was out and clearly revealed to us were the German fortifications and the sea obstacles that had been planted to tear the batten out of any unsuspecting ship. When the command was given the armed motorized vehicles went ashore first. We had been thoroughly briefed as to what to do on landing. It was hard work wading through the water and soft bank, particularly with a bomb sack on one's back. To our surprise it was eerily quiet on shore. Everyone had his own rations and water. An office not connected to our hospital directed us. We were hot, dirty and exhausted but managed to trudge our way inland for 3 or 4 miles until we reached some farmer's field where we were told we'd spend the night. Up to this time we hadn't heard a sound of gunfire. That was soon to end. As soon as dusk set in all hell broke loose. I was frightened as I'm sure my companions were too. We were expected to rest and sleep till daybreak. The din of artillery and anti-aircraft fire was constant. For novices like us it was impossible to rest. At daybreak we were again mustered to march and finally we reached our destination. There was nothing there except a provincial road and farmer's fields and orchards on both sides. By this time we had discovered that we were in Normandy and that we had landed at a place called Arromanches.
Surprisingly the logistics of assembling us, bringing the hundreds of tents and other necessities all arrived on schedule. Many of the staff began digging their own personal fox holes. Half of us didn't bother at all. Little by little the hospital began to take shape. The tents were erected. The equipment was assembled.
The huge tents to accommodate the casualties were assembled. The cots for patients arrived. The surgical instruments, the drugs, the dressings and all the other surgical items arrived. The last to arrive were the portable kitchens. Up till the all we had were cold rations. Soon we could look forward to something hot.
Little by little #10 Canadian General Hospital became assembled. All the services fell into shape. The generators to power the operating room lights, the x-ray machines but no lights elsewhere.
My classmate Abe Earn from Winnipeg scored a tiny bell shaped tent and later that summer we salvaged an enormously heavy battery from a burnt out German tank. We hauled it over beside our tent with the help of a truck. We then led a couple of wires to a headlamp of a blown up vehicle and presto we had a little light to serve us after dark. It was amazing the capacity of that battery. It lasted from early summer till late fall in November when the hospital moved to Belgium. I was not qualified to do casualty surgery but was kept quite busy with medical problems.
I had my first exposure to cases of malaria. But my most memorable problem was a young British soldier who contracted "Weil's Disease" a disease contracted by exposure to water which had been contaminated by infected rats. It's a severe, usually fatal disease. I had the distinction of being the first physician ever to treat and cure a case of Weil's Disease with penicillin - which had just been released to our hospital.
Naturally I was encouraged to publish the case which eventually appeared in a military medical journal
Early in July 1944 the fighting on the front became very heavy. The casualties were coming in streams of convoys and the hospital literally bulged with about a thousand wounded. The casualties were a mixed bag. Many were British with small groups of Poles and French but the majority were our own Canadians. One day as a convoy of ambulances arrived a soldier came running to me to tell me some guy was being taken in and insisted that he was my relation and needed to see me at once. It didn't take long to find Sidney Civkin my brother in law lying on a stretcher. He had sustained a piece of shrapnel in his buttock and was in great pain and practically in shell shock. He was terribly concerned that his parents would receive on of those frightening army telegrams - "we regret to inform you that your son - has been wounded in action. Extent of injuries unknown. Further particulars will follow."
I immediately sent a cable to Freda telling her of Sid's wound and reassured the family. My cable arrived well before the Army message. I had done a good deed. Sid's recovery was anything but smooth. To complicate matters he developed severe haemorrhoids which required surgery. Sidney was the medical officer of a battalion of the Royal Hamilton Light Infantry and had been exposed to heavy fire in action.
I felt sorry for him to be wounded but it was nice to have a member of the family at hand and with whom we could discuss family problems. The war was progressing favourably and on August 23rd 1944 Paris was liberated. This major event coincided with my birthday and no more joyous occasion could have been planned. Naturally the city became strictly out of bounds.
Needless to say most of us desperately wanted to get there and see for ourselves a little of life in a liberal Paris.
Needless to say a Jeep was soon found and of we went to the big city. We had been briefed that under no circumstances were we to try to get military lodging or try to wrangle food from some army unit. We would promptly be arrested with unknown consequences. The first thing our tiny group did was check in to a third rate hotel for a place to sleep. We knew food would be difficult to get so we brought along whatever we could lay our hands on. But it wasn't nearly enough and before long we were literally facing starvation. Every scrap of food needed a ration coupon and we had none. We managed to survive and on our return we felt as if we had participated in a great and glorious adventure.
Another wonderful trip we took soon afterwards was to visit the famous monastic fortress and walled city of Mont St. Michel in Brittany.
Our hospital was close to the main town of the district Bayeux. The cathedral had been the repository of the famous Bayeux tapestries. These had been carefully stashed away by the custodians when war erupted. In the town was a tiny jewel of a theatre dating from Napoleonic days. Every night there would be an entertainment. At one performance we saw the famous artist Door Novello and his co-star Diana ____ (I can't recall her last name). I had seen her previously on screen at home. The play was a mystery and very well done. The little theatre packed to the rafters with soldiers erupted with tumultuous applause at the conclusion of the performance. For most of the Canadian audience this was the very first live performance of a play any of them had ever seen.
By mid-October there were definite signs that summer was now at an end. The temperatures were quite cool particularly at night. But most unpleasant was the onset of very damp and rainy weather. We managed to scrounge a little kerosene heater which was only marginally helpful in reducing the cold and damp in our tiny bell tent. Little by little the weather continued to cool and the rains much heavier and more prolonged. The hospital which continued to be quite busy was now floating in a sea of mud. We all knew that efforts were being made to find a suitable hospital site for us, further north to be closer to the front lines.
In November we had a taste of what troops suffered in the trenches during World War I. The rain was interminable and the cold seemed to permeate every bone in our bodies.
Finally, at the end of November 1944 the glad tidings that a suitable site and buildings had been found for the hospital arrived. We were all ecstatic that finally we would have a real roof over our heads.
There was a tremendous task ahead. What does one do with a thousand casualties? The logistics of moving and setting up were very formidable. We were finally told that we would move to a Northern Belgian city called Tarrenpaut. This had been the site of a very large, permanent Belgian military complex before the German occupation. After Belgium had been overrun by the Nazis it became a German camp. And now it was to be a Canadian military Hospital. The move was done with extraordinary expediency. Within a week or ten days we finally had a real roof over our heads. There were four large brick buildings enclosing a huge paved courtyard which had been designed as a parade square. The Germans had been in such a rush to get out that they left everything intact. There were hundreds of beds. There were lecture halls. The kitchens were fully equipped and in immaculate condition. Even the electric generator were in perfect working order.
Little did we know that we would soon be in the heart of a new and violent phase of the war.
We had previously been warned that we would be in the direct path of the German pilotless "Buzz bombs" on their way to London. The drone of these missiles of destruction was constantly over our heads. As long as the drone could be heard one was safe. Should the drone suddenly stop it meant that the bomb was on its way down. The only evasion we could take was get on the floor as quickly as possible. The drone was constant and uninterrupted.
A much greater menace was on the horizon. A huge German offensive was being prepared. One that would encircle and trap hundreds of thousand of Allied Troops including ourselves. The offensive was launched between Christmas and New Years of 1944 - 45. The weather had become dull and foggy which effectively grounded the Allied Air Force. At first the German offensive was very swift and effective. Its purpose was to reach the sea and trap the allied Forces. The battles reached within walking distance of our city and for the first time our fears were not of being hurt or killed but of being taken prisoner.
Everyone became irritable and tense. None of us could distinguish Allied from German artillery fire, the din was constant. Eventually the fog began to lift and Allied planes became airborne again. The Germans had no air force to speak of. Before long the Germans had to retreat and we all sensed it was the beginning of the end.
Nevertheless the ?'Buzz Bombs" continued their constant drone and the casualties continued to arrive.
As the winter gave way to spring it became obvious that the Germans were in the death throes of total defeat. Not only were our Allied forces clearing Western Europe of the German Scourge but the Russians were brilliant in slaughtering countless enemies. In May 1945 the "end" finally arrived. The Russians captured Berlin and Hitler and his entourage committed suicide or were captured.
We continued to be very busy at the hospital. But now our casualties were quite different.
The hospital became a centre for the treatment of syphilis and diphtheria. For syphilis we now had penicillin - the newly discovered wonder drug. Diphtheria was raging in the Prisoner of Warm camps as well as amongst unimmunized Canadian troops. I was one of the doctors assigned to care for the syphilites and the diphtheria stricken. None of us had any pervious experience in treating diphtheria. Our only guides were some outdated medical books. There was hardly a day when we didn't have 2 -3 deaths. Our chief wired London for help and they sent us a specialist in communicable diseases. He straightened us out in a hurry and within days our mortality rate dropped down to near zero.
Then came the German casualties. They were assigned their own wards with German officers to Imperialize their management. I hated making my daily rounds of these enemy wards. The contrast to the informality of the Canadian troops was startling. As my little entourage approached the ward the German officer in charge would salute smartly and bellow out "Achtung". The wounded would stare stiffly at the ceiling with their arms rigidly at their sides. No one was permitted to lie on their sides or sit in beds. Their blankets would be tucked in tightly around them. The appearance was that of a bunch of dummies laid out for inspection. An interpreter would accompany me and my nurse as I went from bed to bed. There was never an exchange of pleasantries or cheering remarks. I hated this work.
The most trying of all duties came when we began to receive the living corpses from the Concentration camps. I shall never forget these emaciated bodies. Most were quite soundless. It was amazing how rare it was to hear them speak. Occasionally I would lapse into my broken Yiddish in the hope of getting a response. Occasionally I did. The death rate amongst them was extraordinarily high - as I guess perhaps fifty percent. Our facilities for convalescence and rehabilitation were non existent. Those who survived were shipped out elsewhere as soon as they were able.
By May the war was officially over but nevertheless one had to exercise extreme caution when travelling. It was during that month that I had a chance to see the devastation wrought by our bombers on Cologne, Essen, Dusseldorf and Hamburg. At that time it seemed inconceivable that the masses of rubble would soon be cleared and sparkling new cities arise to take their place.
In July we vacated the spacious hospital we had occupied in Turnfout and were transferred to much less pretentious buildings in Bruges also in Flemish Belgium. I immediately fell in love with this small mediaeval city. It was a step back to the seventeenth century. It was there that I became acquainted with those great Flemish artists. Brueghel, Memling, Steen, Ter Bosen and many others. Many of their paintings would hang quite causally in public houses mainly around the central square. Many of the paintings depicted life in the Central Square as it was in the seventeenth century. Other than the costumes worn by the citizens three hundred years ago the scene was totally unchanged.
The summer of 1945 was a most pleasant one. Mainly because I had 2 week long leaves in Paris. My first leave was ostensibly to take some sort of course. I can recall nothing of the few lectures I attended but I do recall the beauty of the surroundings. We stayed in Canada House which was on the campus of the Cité Universitaire. It seemed that every European country as well as many others throughout the world had its own building. The centre piece of the whole campus was a large imposing building called the Rockefeller Centre - presumably named after its benefactor. The campus was somewhere in south Paris on its left bank. Most of us quickly learned how to get to the heart of the city on the subway - which in Paris is called the Metro. We also had ample opportunity to do the usual sight seeing as well as getting to Versailles.
The other leave in Paris was on my own. I stayed in a Canadian officer "mess" where the meals and accommodation were excellent. That trip was highlighted by visits to the Folies Bergère, the Moulin Rouge and others.
There was another brief excursion I recall quite clearly. This one was to Amsterdam. It was during the first fortnight in August 1945. As usual, I stayed in Canadian officer's quarters. It was situated in the main square of the city called the DAM. It rained constantly and most of us spent our time playing cards.
While playing cards one of the fellows remarked about the news he had just heard on the radio. Apparently the announcer said that the Americans had dropped a "blockbuster" of a bomb on some city in Japan. It was so powerful that it had completely destr

was and probably still is at St. Larmaert.
In Brussels in the mediaeval market squares I bought Freda a Belgian Rose point embroidered handkerchief. Sidney bought a very fine evening hand bag as a present for his sister and which I was entrusted to bring home to her. Everything arrived safely in Winnipeg.
With little to do in the hospital life began to drag. Day in and day out in hope in vain for news of possible repatriation. Eventually summer gave way to fall and still no word about going home
Finally it came to pass. Sidney had been posted to Brussels where he was able to spy on repatriation lists. Hallelujah! He found both our names on a homeward bound list. Not only were we leaving for England on the same day but our departure for home was booked on the same boat - the Empress of Scotland. The very same ship which had brought me to Europe in May 1943. When I got the news I became so excited that I began to drink large amounts of gin. I was never a drinker and my tolerance of alcohol was really very limited. What I do remember is that I eventually passed out. When I regained consciousness I became violently ill. I paid dearly for my elation. The date of departure was finally set as November 14th, 1945.
The crossing was a nightmare. The ship tossed about like a cork. Many of the porthole windows were blown out like candles and for several days all troops were forbidden to be on any deck. There were many casualties, mainly fractured arms or leg and lacerations due to flying glass. The air was very warm which make the cabin areas stiflingly hot. This added to the stench of roijicters made life unbearable.
Suddenly the climate changed. As we approached the coast of Newfoundland we left the warm waters of the Gulf Steam and entered frigid Canadian waters. We finally docked in Halifax. What a relief it was to leave the misery of the North Atlantic.
Prior to leaving Belgium Freda and I had decided to meet in Montreal and proceed from there to New York. Both of us managed to wrangle free transportation to the Big Apple. Sidney arranged to meet an old girl friend there - a Trepel. A younger sister of Freda Trepel who already had a wide reputation as a concert pianist. The girl Sid was interested in was also a fine musician - a cellist.
When we arrived in New York our instructions were to proceed to an accommodation "desk". We were given a wide choice of accommodation. We opted for the most expensive choice of all. A choice we've never regretted. The hotel was the exclusive Pierre. We had never been in such luxurious surroundings. The week was utterly exhilarating. The special rate for soldiers was $5.00 per day. What a bargain!
To make matters more extraordinary the Americans confused my Canadian dress uniform with its three epaulet pips for that of a three star general. Waiters bowed to us and waved us to the best tables without benefit of a reservation. Bartenders poured us gigantic drinks and refused payment. We saw plays, musicals and were lunched and dined by Sam and Yetta Pearlman.
Both Sidney and I had forgotten about Winnipeg's early winter climate. We returned to Winnipeg sometime in December 1945. Alex was 3½ and David not yet 2. Both children were repelled by the sight of this stranger and intruder.
The children were not only resentful of my presence but I think were somewhat frightened. Their attitude was instinctive and perfectly normal. A stranger had descended on them and appropriated their mother. Little by little our thoughts turned to the immediate challenges of returning to practice, establishing a home and supporting a family.
Our finances were in dismal shape. It was imperative that I secure an income as soon as possible. I could only think of Regina as a place to settle. At least until I could support my little family. I had no home in Regina, I had no practice nor did I have an office. I was not panic stricken but neither was I confident of my success.
There were so many things to attend to as 1945 was slowly drawing to a close. It then dawned on me that I had no car. There were no cars to be bought and no cars had been built after America had joined the war in December 1941. I was told that I was eligible to buy a used car by getting a permit. Being a doctor and a veteran were the magic words. Then one had to scan the paper for used cars for sale. They too needed a permit to sell.
My finances had to be rigidly apportioned. I had somewhere between five to six thousand dollars. The car I bought was an enormous black Lincoln sedan. It ran but consumes enormous quantities of gas and oil. I had little choice in the matter and paid several hundred dollars for this necessity. We phoned the Bosins in Regina to inquire about houses and offices. We were told that these were unobtainable. They invited me to come and stay with them and to look around for an office and a house.
I took up their invitation and arrived in Regina a few days later. Needless to say I was warmly welcomed. I had hoped that the office I had previously occupied in the Broden building might be available to me - particularly in view of the fact that I was a veteran. It was sorry, sorry, sorry Doc. I don't know who tipped me off that a Mr. Graut had just bought a building on Broad Street. I saw him at once and sure enough he had a very large office available. The rent he wanted was very reasonable and it included putting up some partitions for me as well as decorating the office. I think he wanted me to move in. Within a week I had purchased some second hand furniture and was ready to resume practice on what I could scrounge for patients.
The last problem to solve was a place to live. In those days there were two Regina papers, the Star and the Leader-Post. There was nothing to rent but there were a few houses for sale.
I refused to see any home on my own. Freda agreed to come to Regina to look over the few that very available. A two story house about 10 years old was available but not for about 2 months hence, they wanted $9300.00 for it. Freda loved it at once. There were 3 bedrooms with a spacious well appointed bathroom The floors, the window frames, the doors and baseboards were a beautiful oak. Downstairs there was a pleasant entry hall with a parquet floor and the front door was embellished with fine bevelled glass. The door to the clothes closet was faced with a full length mirror, it too had bevelled glass.
The living room was on the left as you entered and on its far wall was a large fireplace faced with a rough reddish brick. The mantle was of oak. Facing the street were 3 large windows covered with Venetian blinds fashioned from oak slats to match all the other woodwork. The dining room to the right of the living room had windows facing the back garden. The kitchen was lovely with the counter and back splash of Dutch motif ceramic tile.
I didn't have $9300 and I don't recall how the finances were arranged. Everything seemed to fall into place. After completing the negotiations to purchase Freda returned to Winnipeg and I moved into a downtown hotel called the Kitchener. My rent was $35.00 a month with daily maid service. There was a dining room and lunch counter attached. I would have breakfast there but my main meal was at lunch which I would have at Simon's restaurant nest to the Army &amp; Navy. The food was excellent and the price not more that 35¢ for a full course meal. It was also a great place socially and particularly to resume contact with many of my former patients. Certain days were particularly important. Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays were favourite days for farmers to shop at the Army &amp; Navy. The war had wrought a tremendous transformation to the economy of Saskatchewan. Crops were excellent and the prices for grain generous. Hardly a day went by that I wouldn't be greeted very warmly by a long forgotten rural patient. "When did you get back, Doc?" or "Where is your office?".
One day a farmer named McDonald sidled up to me and asked me casually how much he owed me from the Francis days. I confessed I didn't know. He then pulled out a fat roll of bills from his pocked and pulled off $80.00 that represented a great deal of money to me, and I was most grateful.
Little by little my practice began to grow and before long I felt I was actually going to make a living. The main difficulty was being separated from Freda and the boys.
Finally "our" house was vacated and became available for occupancy on or about June 1st 1946. The furniture from Winnipeg arrived on time. It seemed that we were settled in no time at all. This was our first "real" home and we loved it.
My practice grew rapidly and I still recall the sense of accomplishment when I grossed $14,000.00 during my first year.
Socially we were very busy! There were many Jewish couples our age. We were remarkably compatible. Hardly a week-end went by without a party. They were very happy parties. We danced to records and drank to the limit of our tolerance. I recall one party in particular. Rose Hoffer got rid of all her inhibitions. She went to the basement found an old pair of army issue long johns, discarded her own clothes. Garbed in this underwear she stuffed a grapefruit in her panties and a banana stuck out of the fly. She made a spectacular drunken entrance.
It didn't take long for the two boys to adjust to their new environment. Although only 4 years old Alex was enrolled in a nursery school. He took his new challenges in stride and became an instant "school boy". David was only 2 but showed a remarkable aptitude for reading. He recognized words with ease and although still a baby in diapers could read the captions of illustrated children's books.
We became friendly with our neighbours, particularly the Blacks -- Don and Nan --. Their 2 children a boy and a girl - Michael and Linda became our boys' best friends. Both Don and Nan were highly intelligent and well educated and we enjoyed their friendship immensely. The Normans who lived across the street also became friends. Stan Norman was a young lawyer. They had one child - a little girl about Alex's age. I think her name was Valerie. Unfortunately Stan died about 15 years ago from cancer.
Because of the ease which Alex adjusted to nursery school we thought it worth while to enrol David as well. I don't think David was 3 yet. He wasn't really ready yet and prone to soil his pants. The nursery school teacher was a Mrs. Smith. She was highly intelligent - very well educated and was probably overqualified. She let David run his own show. He was a loner and spent most of his time playing contentedly by himself.
Sometime in 1948 barely 2 years after living in our "new" house one of our friends Nate Robinson, announced that he found an ideal summer cottage for us and the Bosins. We could buy this lakefront property for $2000.00 or $1000.00 each. Nate was so persuasive and so adamant that we decided to go ahead and scrape together the $2000.00 to complete the purchase. The cottage was on a heavily treed lot facing west smack on the waterfront. The lot was narrow only 50' but extended at least 250' to the road allowance. There was no electricity or no water. A small "Quebec" stove served as a heating source in chilly weather. The "back" yard was a mass of old soft prairie maple trees, young ash saplings and tangles of Saskatoon bushes. The sides of the cottage were screened verandas.
In those days, before the advent of detergents, chemical fertilizers and other pollutants the lake was crystal clear in its pristine beauty. "Our" lake called Katepwa was one of several strung out for about a hundred miles carved out of the prairie during the ice age. The valley was about 2 or 300 feet below the prairie plain and was a beautiful sight to behold as you descended from the plateau of the prairie. The suddenness of its appearance - totally unexpected to the casual traveller could be an unforgettable sight. The lakes connected to each other by the Qu'Appelle River were a natural highway and waterway for Indians and explorers. Why the valley is called Qu'Appelle has never been adequately explained.
That first summer at the "Lake" with both our little families working like beavers was a memorable one. We were four adults and three children. The Basins and ourselves got along surprisingly well and truly worked like beavers to make the place habitable.
That spring Freda had become pregnant. She had no unpleasant symptoms, gained very little weight and didn't "show" a telltale bulge until late fall of 1948. When the Bosins realized that we were expecting our third child they decided to build their own cottage on land given to them by Ethel's sister Bella Kravinsky. The land was only a couple of hundred yards away from our own. By this time I could reimburse the Basins the $1000.00 which was their equity on our joint purchase. They began construction almost immediately.
We were not idle with our plans, either. Electricity was brought to the cottagers that first winter so that our plans included proper wiring, lowering the ceiling and enclosing the west and south sides with picture windows. Consequently our living room doubled in size. We acquired adequate closet space, 3 bedrooms and a large glazed porch to accommodate visitors. With electricity came a refrigerator and freezer and our own well with an automatic pump.
Ruth Ellen was born in January 1949. This completed our little family. But now other problems loomed on the horizon. The house we enjoyed so much was obviously too small for our needs particularly when we had live in help. The boys shared a bedroom, Ruthie was in a crib in our room and our "maid" had the third bedroom.
Following in her brother's footsteps Ruthie was not a "good" baby. She cried incessantly. In retrospect it is now obvious that the children were intolerant to cow's milk. Unfortunately the milk substitutes commonly used today were unknown at that time. By the time cottage "time" rolled around the renovations to the cottage were complete - or almost complete.
With each successive month after Ruthie's birth our house became more and more crowded. The only solution was to move into a more spacious house. Housing was a major problem in a small city like Regina. Much larger communities like Winnipeg were also hard pressed to fill the demand. Building supplies were in very short supply and many builders were afraid to build new homes for fear of a return to the days of the well remembered and dreaded recession. To make matters worse there were recurrent rumours of reimposition of war time price controls.
We began to look at some of the larger, older and more spacious homes in our district which was called Lakenion. Our problem was mostly ignorance and tunnel vision. The homes available were all in the $20 - 30,000.00 range. The price seemed astronomical to me.
We did see some fine old houses. The problem - or so we thought - was the fact that most needed upgrading - usually the kitchen. We suffered from timidity and short-sightedness.
We heard of a new home being built in our district. We went to see it and what we saw looked interesting. It was a bungalow type with a dive in garage and above the garage just a few steps above the main floor was a spacious 4th bedroom if needed. All the rooms were fairly bright and airy. The price seemed fairly high - $20,000.00 or more than twice as much as we paid for our first house. After much soul searching we decided to commit ourselves to moving. Selling our house was no problem. We got $13,000 for the house so that there was a shortfall of $7000.00 which we financed with a mortgage at 5% but with the option of paying off the principal outstanding after 3 years. I remained trapped psychologically in the depths of the depression. Being in debt was almost too painful to bear.
The new house was still unfurnished and it was mid April 1950 before we moved in. by this time, Ruthie was a toddler and was much more tolerant of milk.
Naturally we had "live in help". The basement of the new house had been partitioned. The floor was covered with linoleum ties and there was a bathroom with a stall shower. There was a laundry room which also included the furnace and a very large "playroom".
Our new house and recently acquired cottage together with new developments in my practice make life challenging and interesting.
During the winter of 1948 - 1949 Dr. Kravinsky had asked me to care for his practice while he and his wife were away. They were away in New York while he took a course in cancer surgery at the memorial hospital. They were away for four months.
I worked very hard indeed. Unfortunately our fees were very small in those days. Office visits were on average $2 -3.00. House calls, even at night, were rarely more than $5.00.
A doctor earning between $12 - 18,000.00 a year was considered to have an excellent income.
When Kravinsky returned from New York we began discussing the possibility of combining our practices.
The ground floor of a little building on Rose Street was available. A few simple partitions was all it needed to accommodate three or four doctors as well as room for a business office and a lab and x-ray.
Mitchell Finkelstein who was born and raised in Regina was practising in Weyburn and was very anxious to move to Regina. This made us into a little group of 3 and immediately conjured up the title or Regina Medical Centre.
From the moment we moved we became very busy. Soon we needed a fourth hand to help us cope. Dr. Murray Eutkin - an easterner and newly married was anxious to join us for a salary of $4000.00 per year. He was a wonderful addition to our little group. He was particularly interested in obstetrics. I had become very popular as a "maternity" doctor and a few years later I did as many as 150 deliveries a year. At no time do I recall being paid more than $50.00 a case.
Before long we realized that we were outgrowing our premises. None of us had any money to speak of. Kravinsky whose income was much larger that ours because of his surgical referrals had spent very large sums of money on extricating his daughter Grace from her husband Bert Leny. Bert an English Jew had appeared in Regina during the war as a major attached to the British army. He was a con man and a scoundrel. To make matters worse it was later discovered that he was a bigamist with a wife and several children in England. After successfully blackmailing Kravinsky into losing most of his life savings he finally agreed to divorce Gracie and give her custody of their two children.
To me this period in my life was an eventful one and although my digression to recollect the sad affairs of the Kravinsky family may be out of place nevertheless it was important. Ralph Kravinsky their son had been going to University in Vancouver where he met his future wife Ruth Becker. Ralph and his new bride had to be supported as well as Grace and her two children. Ralph had no profession and no job prospects. He had tried his hand at business both in Vancouver and Montreal. All of them fruitless and expensive to his father. Nevertheless he supported his growing family with dignity.
An opportunity to buy a city owned vacant lot two doors south of our little clinic presented itself. The time was late 1950 and the price was $17,000.00. The city stipulated that a sale at that price necessitated the erection of a building with a building permit value of at least $200,000.00. In those days this seemed like an astronomical price to us. After much soul searching we decided that the only way we could finance the project was to search for more partners. We were told that Stanley Abrams the optometrist was very interested as well as Gordon Kliman a druggist. When we discussed the matter with Abrams he told us that his brother in law Saul Cohen who was then practising in Melville was also very anxious to move to Regina. The plan was for each partner to invest $10,000.00. This would give us and a proposed company $60,000.00 to purchase the city lot and engage an architect to come up with a plan.
Three of my classmates had joined a group in Winnipeg and had just completed the construction of a clinic building. They called themselves the Mall Medical Clinic and because I knew three of them I was elected to go to Winnipeg for ideas. The three were Erwin Brotman, Laurie Robson (Robinovitch) and David Bruser. They showed me the building, explained how it functioned and only had glowing reports. At no time were any shortcomings listed.
The building was a split level design, copied form ideas coming out of California at the time.
We all agreed that this was the way to proceed and Dan Stoch our engaged architect proceeded with the plans.
The $10,000.00 each of us was required to deposit with the new firm was a very large sum indeed. Strangely, I have no clear recollection how I managed to raise this sum. The company to manage the building was named Professional Associates. All of the six principals including our wives became shareholders. The reason for this was the burden of succession duties in the event of misfortune befalling any of us.
Construction began in early 1951 and we moved into our spanking new building in 1952.
None of us could afford high rent and our budget left nothing for a contingency fund. We paid our bills promptly as well as the mortgage payments.
Our contractor was a man called Hilsden. He was remarkably efficient and honest. He suffered from asthma and emphysema and became my patient until his death many years later. His wife an equally fine woman remained my patient until I retired from practice.
As I write of these events which occurred 40 years ago I began to recollect some of the difficulties which began to arise. It soon became evident that neither Abrams the optometrist or Klinan the druggist were paying a fair share of the rent. Not only did they plead poverty but were constantly complaining that they were getting no referrals from us. Their nagging was so persistent and amazing that we soon tired of this bickering so that no rental adjustment was made.
Life at home was equally hectic. The children were growing. The boys at school were busy with friends, play and the beginning of Hebrew school. Another Jewish family moved onto our street. They built a large 2 storey home. The Schewarfields were a well known merchant family in Regina and their eldest child Terry became a life long friend of Ruthie's.
Television arrived in Regina in 1952 and our play room became a hangout for the little children on the block who every afternoon would sit in front of the Philco set enthralled with the likes of Howdy Doody.
Domestically we were fortunate in our choice of hired live-in help. There was a young farm girl called Elsie. The children liked her. She did everything Freda instructed her to do but she had a tendency to be very moody and was only with us for a couple of years.
In the meantime we seemed to have a constant stream of visitors. There were my parents as well as Freda's - who seemed to alternate their visits.
They were good visitors in that they did little complaining. My father loved to go for walks and the Civkins were educational. They talked and argued interminably. Always on interesting topics. Celia Civkin was a dyed in the wool Communist. She was constantly defending the Soviet Union as well as Joseph Stalin. She refused to accept any deviation from the pronouncements from Moscow. Solomon Civkin was also a dyed in the wool Socialist but also staunchly anti-Stalinist. The verbal battles spiced with insults and insective and always conducted in rapid fire Yiddish was amusing to me but Freda was usually hurt and saddened.
In those days (in the early fifties) travel was almost invariably by train and our parents would always arrive exhausted and headachy. It would take them a day or two to regain their health.
In 1950 Sidney returned from Britain where he had done graduate work in otolaryngology and decided that the prairies were NOT for him. Isaac Stoffman had established in Vancouver and was doing very well professionally and financially. Sidney soon found a likely place to practice in New Westminster - a suburb of Vancouver. Before long he became established. How he met Estelle Mindess of Winnipeg I cannot recall. I was best man at their wedding in Winnipeg.
They bought a modest bungalow in N. Westminster. They were very anxious for someone to visit them and we did so in February of 1952 or 1953. We enjoyed our visit very much. It was during this first visit that Sidney spoke to me in the privacy of his car about difficulties with Estelle. She was pregnant but was constantly nagging, complaining and even accused him of infidelity. She was making life miserable for him. He didn't really expect any advice from me except to unburden himself.
Freda was aware of an undercurrent of friction between them but it was not until we returned to Regina that I told her of Sidney's woes.
Life in Regina revolved around the children and a very hectic social life. There was a continuous stream of parties. They were happy parties, with lots of food, a great deal of liquor and dancing and music.
The Kravinskys, the Robinsons, the Bosins, the Sandouirskys, the Hoffers and ourselves constituted what was euphemistically called the "inner circle".
It was the inner circle that had the best parties and seemed to have the most fun. The most flamboyant of all New Year's Eve bashes was our party at the Hotel Saskatchewan. We would reserve a large suite and have a bathtub filled with ice. Every couple brought 2 bottles of Mumm's Champagne. No other drink was permitted.
A large table was reserved for us in the ballroom where we dance and after midnight had a gargantuan meal. To be invited to our affairs was considered a privilege. New Years Day was always celebrated with a brunch at one of our homes which always lasted well into the night.
Again there were mountains of food, and a "booze" table.
In 1954 we realized that Alex' Bar Mitzvah was approaching and we began to plan accordingly. His Bar Mitzvah was planned for the spring of 1955. Although his birthday was in April we though that May would be a more pleasant time of the year. April weather in Saskatchewan could be very unpredictable.
We began to plan in earnest. We finally decided to have a dinner and dance at the Hotel Saskatchewan. The ballroom was booked, a band was engaged and the dinner menu decided on. Nowadays such a pretentious plan is a common occurrence but in 1954 -55 it was very unusual. Naturally there was a luncheon to be served at the Synagogue. This had to be Kosher so that all the food had to be prepared in the Synagogue.
Another problem was the accommodation we had to provide for our "out of town" family. There were 4 grandparents, as well as my sister Esther and her 3 children. There was also our live in "maid" and only 2 bathrooms in the house. Fortunately everyone was on their best behaviour. Sam Pearlman come in from New York as did his 2 older sisters from Winnipeg. Freda's cousins, the Miles and Carrs were there as well as was Sidney who flew in alone from Vancouver. His flight was an early one on this newly created Canadian National Airlines called in those days Trans Canada Airlines.
We had a wonderful time. The grandparents were on their best behaviour and the dinner dance on Saturday night was a great success. Alex' performance was faultless. It was customary for the Bar Mitzvah boy to make a speech - usually a string of platitudes but Alex was insistent on composing his own. He did very well indeed. Old man Civkin was so carried away with pride that he began to applaud. We had to restrain him from continuing.
It was after the Bar Mitzvah that I became aware that Kravinsky was suffering from angina and intermittent attacks of atrical fibreallation.
Max Israels was the premier cardiologist in Regina but it soon became evident to us all that his ability to maintain the stress of a busy practice - predominantly surgical was now markedly diminished. The thought of having someone replace him was anathema to him - and to a lesser degree ourselves.
A young fully qualified surgeon soon became available. He was a native Reginan. Andy Sowchuk began to help Kravinsky in the operating room but soon was doing the bulk of the surgery. He was an excellent surgeon and before long he resigned and left for the USA.
Later another young Reginan, fully qualified in surgery joined our group. He too was a wonderful surgeon but as with Sawchuk he left our group to practice as a consultant surgeon.
Nevertheless we were all very busy and although none of us had any capital to speak of we were considered to be prosperous physicians. In the day the fee schedule was so small that one had to see many patients on a daily basis to make ends meet.
During the 50's the Bosins and ourselves decided that we deserved an extended holiday and made plane to have a regular European fund to which we contributed a monthly sum.
In the meantime, David's Bar Mitzvah was approaching. We decided to forego a lavish dinner and dance and instead have a great party in our house. Again there was the deluge of visitors from Winnipeg as well as from Toronto. We had a great time. I shall never forget finding two of our friends sound asleep in the basement the next day. Clara Samuels and Louise Isman had simply passed out and their husbands decided to leave them where they were.
Following the Bar Mitzvah Freda and I decided on a holiday to New York. We had been going to New York every other year. After all - we had family there. Freda's uncle Sam Pearlman now resided in Manhattan and I had my Auntie Jenny Schwartzman and her family as well.
We had been staying at the St. Moritz Hotel on the Part and enjoyed the location very much. We saw plays, shopped, lunched or dined with relatives and simply enjoyed the pleasures of a great city. In those days we walked the streets at all hours without fear of being "mugged". As a matter of fact the term mugged had not yet joined the lexicon of American usage.
In 1957 my brother Ken, his wife June and their 3 children had arrived from Ireland. He had a year of internship to fulfil before he could get his license to practice. This he did and we offered him a job at the clinic for $6000.00 a year. This was considered to be a generous salary and at the "high end" of salaries offered recent graduates. They accepted the offer. We found them a bungalow for rent and even furnished it for them before they arrived. Before long they decided by buy a home. They bought a brand new bungalow for $16,000.00. Before long they became fully integrated into the community. Ken became active in a theatre group and June wrote the occasional columns for the Leader-Post in Regina. She was a gifted writer and her columns had an Irish lilt to them which made them quite charming.
As the months went by we began to notice that June was becoming very irritable and touchy. She would often slip into a heated monologue about Irish politics and the injustices perpetrated by the Evil English.
In the meantime an additional surgeon joined our little clinic, Noel Cutler was Jewish, he has recently receive his qualifications in surgery, he was married and had 2 children. His appearance was nondescript and his personality was anything but warm. Nevertheless he was a very capable surgeon and relieved Kravinsky of almost all the burden he was shouldering.
With the medical practice under control the Bosins and ourselves began to make plans for a European holiday. Our itinerary was not the same.
I had made up may mind that if I could get a visa to the USSR and book a hotel, meals and a guide through the newly established Intourist we would go.. This was at the height of the Cold War and most of our friends thought that we were very rash to go.
Nevertheless we planned our itinerary with great care. We first flew to Rome where we met the Bosins. We toured the city, we walked endlessly, we dined elegantly and went to the opera where we ogled the aristocracy who paraded their finery in front of us.
After a week in Rome we bade good by to the Bosins and proceeded to Milan. We couldn't resist La Scala and a side trip to the Lombaby Lakes. We had never seen such beauty before. It was still April in 1959. The flowers, the foliage the Lakes nestled in the Italian Alps - the sight became indelibly etched in our minds.
Our itinerary then took us to Zurich in Switzerland. We had not planned on spending any time there. But getting to the Soviet Union from Italy was impossible. Our next stop was to Prague in Czechoslovakia. Our itinerary had been carefully planned. We had a chauffeur and a guide waiting for us in Zagreb. Our stay was short but very memorable. We visited the little street where Kafka lived. The whole street is now a museum. The houses are working class dwellings - each brightly painted. The street is cobbled. The houses are fully furnished and inhabited by lifelike mannequins. The effect is very striking.
We visited the oldest synagogue in Europe as well as the oldest Jewish community.
The city has a great deal of charm and is quite unlike other European capitals. Our young guide was fluent in English. He had never been abroad and when we asked if we could give him something he had only one request. Did we have a "TIME" magazine we could let him have? Unfortunately we had no reading material to give him.
On May 4th 1959 we finally departed for Moscow. We flew in a Russian aircraft and it was a revelation. The plane was packed and yet amazingly comfortable. The seating was totally unlike anything we had seen before. It was similar to that of old railway cars. Two seats faced two opposites. A folding table between the two served the four passengers. No seat belts were in evidence and smoking was permitted at anytime The informality was extraordinary. Every passenger seemed to be in possession of a bottle of liquor and may had small musical instruments. Before long songs burst out.
Soon the stewardesses were serving a meal. The chicken was hot and delicious.
Another surprise was the "toilet". Unlike the cramped dark and uncomfortable cubicles in American planes this one was bright and airy with a large window and a little room to move around.
We arrived in Moscow in late afternoon. We were surprised at how cursory the so called "customs inspection" was.
A limousine was waiting to drive us to our hotel destination. The drive seemed endless along long wide streets line with tall, conlike apartment buildings. The hotel turned out to be the gigantic "Ukraine". Our accommodation was an enormous suite. The living room had a grand piano as well as a television.
Every floor had a reception desk where one left the room key. Every other floor had a small "tea room". This proved to be very convenient. The service was fast and you could have coffee, cocoa or tea with pastry or sandwiches at any time. Moreover there were groceries, wines, liquors or bottled water to be bought. All meals and wines and groceries were paid for with coupons we were given when we arrived at the Hotel. I recall quite clearly the excitement of our week in Moscow. We had a guide as well as a car and chauffeur.
Our guide Michael a young man in his early twenties spoke excellent English though he had never been out of the country. We went to the Bolshoi twice to see the Ballet Don Quixote and the Opera Aida. At the Tschaikovsky concert Hall we heard a symphony orchestra with a contralto as soloist. We went to see a spectacular dance troupe which subsequently came to Canada on tour. At the puppet theatre we rubbed shoulders with Anerill Harriman the US ambassador and his guests. We visited Tolstoi's home, we went to the Tretjakov (?) Art Gallery. The Moscow subway was great. The Geun departments store was full of second class merchandise. To visit Lenin and Stalin's tomb did not require us to stand in line. We were given the VIP tour.
The highlight of Moscow was a morning spent at a neighbourhood Poly clinic and another at a children's crèche. The Poly clinic was a g.p. centre for servicing the neighbourhood. Most of the doctors were out making house calls. Those in the clinic were directly involved in preventative medicine.
An interview with the clinic director really turned me off. When I asked her how they treated bedwetting in children her answer was only too revealing. In the Soviet Union children do not wet the bed.
The visit to the nursery school was a joy. The children were beautiful and so well behaved. The school was really not a school but a day-care centre for parents who had to work. The children sand songs and danced and presented Freda with an enormous bouquet of spring flowers. Before leaving we were served tea and cookies. When we asked about the cost of the centre and whether the parents had to pay we were looked at as queers. Pay? Why should they pay? - a Socialist Utopia no less!
Of all the trips we had previously taken as well as those to come none could equal the total recall of our Moscow experience.
We arrived in Paris where we were joined by the Bosins. We stayed in a large hotel on one of the grand boulevards. We ate a great deal at a large variety of restaurants. There was the Georges Cinq and at a glorious setting in the outdoors of Baie de Boulogne. We did what millions of other tourists had done over the ages. There was sightseeing and shopping without end. Our enthusiasm was boundless.
Finally we were approaching the last leg of our voyage. We were to spend 2 weeks in London. Our hotel was called the Washington. It was in the heart of Mayfair and were charged the exorbitant sum of $20.00 a night. Our windows faced the notorious Shepherd's marked. In 1959 the British laws prohibiting hookers from soliciting on the street had not yet been enacted. The market swarmed with whores. It was in the heart of Mayfair and the clients were all well dressed gentlemen. The girls - on the whole - were quite attractive and nicely dressed. It was fascinating to watch them ply their profession.
During our stay in London we saw Alec Lerner on two occasions. Both times we were his guests. One evening we dined at the "Mirabelle" and sat at an adjoining table to Aristotle Onassis and his large group of guests. The restaurant was very impressive.
On another evening we went to the famous Aurabillies. This was the hangout of the "cream" of the young and wealthy aristocracy. Alex pointed out famous titled young men and women. None of their names were familiar to us. It was an experience.
We indulged in theatre and concerts and being in Mayfair, Bond Street, Oxford Street and all the other exotic shops were within an easy stroll.
On our arrival in London a letter from Ruthie awaited us. The news was startling. She informed us that Paula had run away with a boy whose name I can't recall. As for Alex he has broken a leg and was in a cast and on crutches - but not to worry - and not to tell the Bosins about Paula - it might spoil their vacation. The letter was very well written and also added that Mrs. Jaffray the housekeeper we left in charge was managing quite will although under very trying circumstances.
The Bosins were only staying in London for a few days but were probably glad to be flying home to reassure themselves that Ruthie's letter was written tongue in cheek. We returned to Regina in the middle of June and were met at the airport by my brother who told us that Kravinsky had suffered a heart attack and was convalescing in hospital.
Noel Cutler became our official surgical consultant now that Kravinsky had become severely disabled. His appearance was non descript and his personality was anything but warm but he was capable and little by little his surgical patients acquired confidence in his competence.
I had forgotten to write about an important venture we undertook a few years earlier. Donald MacPherson the son of a very prominent lawyer lived next door to our home on Petallack Street. He too was a lawyer. And was associated with is father's firm. One day he broached the subject of renting space in our medical building. His firm needed a minimum of 5000 square feet and he suggested that we consult with our architect about the feasibility of adding another floor to our building.
In retrospect it was no sooner said than one. The rent charged for the whole floor paid for the construction in a few years. By the time the law firm had outgrown our premises and built their own structure our clinic had expanded to the point where we needed all the extra space we could find.
In 1960 I was approved to accept the chairmanship of the department of General Practice at the Regina General Hospital. The following year I was again nominated for another post. This time to be the President of the Regina and District Medical Society.
In the spring of 1962 Freda and I decided on a trip to the up and coming newly fashionable Mexican resort of Acapulco. First we went to Mexico City for a week and then a leisurely bus trip to Cuernavace, Taxco and finally to the sea and Acapulco. We enjoyed the holiday very much but I do recall finding Acapulco much too hot to bear. We were away for about a month. Alex was now in Saskatoon at the University of Saskatchewan and David was in Winnipeg in the faculty of Architecture at the University of Manitoba. Ruthie was well looked after by our "live in" nanny.
On arriving in Regina we were confronted with the news of Kravinsky's death. Events were moving very rapidly at that time.
A major confrontation between doctors and government was gaining momentum at this time.
The NDP government proposed enactment of a Bill to regulate the Medical Profession. This Bill was designed ostensibly for the improvement of the delivery of medical services throughout the province. When the details were made public the 1200 doctors in active practice rose up in protest to denounce the plan. It was an extraordinary show of solidarity.
The various medial districts held emergency meetings. In Regina I had the challenge of chairing innumerable emergency meetings to plan strategy and correlated our activities with the other district societies and with our headquarters in Saskatchewan.
Briefly the governments plan was as follows. Universal medical availability to all citizens at no cost to the patient. The government would have sole power to set the medical fee schedule. The government would have the power to assign doctors to practice in areas the Government considered to be underserviced.
Historically, Saskatchewan doctors had always been in the forefront in providing socially responsible medical care to the province. Saskatchewan was the first area in North America to provide free Sanatorium care for citizens with tuberculosis. It was the first place anywhere to provide free diagnostic and therapeutic care for cancer.
During the great depression, the province pioneered fixed income for doctors in rural areas. And following the second world war a Blue Cross type of medical insurance became available to all citizens. All of those socially responsible measures were pioneered with the active participation of the doctors of the province.
Moreover in 1962 it was calculated that over 80% of the province's population had adequate medical insurance. Since 1949 all of Saskatchewan had 100% hospital insurance. So what was the reason for the draconian laws proposed by the government? Apparently the extreme doctrinaire socialists in government had prevailed. Fee for services was evil! The Medicare scheme proposed - that is - for government to set fees and for government to have control over the location of practice was more than any doctor could bear. The profession was truly up in arms and after innumerable meetings it was decided to withdraw services. The date set was July 1, 1962. Naturally the public was reassured that every such service would be provided for all and that all hospitals would be fully staffed. No fees would be charged for service rendered during the duration. The profession in Saskatchewan was extraordinarily unanimous in supporting the withdrawal of services.
It was fascinating to observe the reaction of the public. It soon became evident that the doctors had the support of the majority of the population. The Socialists began a virulent campaign to malign the profession. Before long individual doctors began receiving threatening letters, then came letters full of abuse, these were followed by direct threats to the safety of the doctor's family. The government was becoming panicky and decided to break the strike with medical scabs. A recruiting team was dispatched to England with offers to pay full fare to British doctors and their families and a generous annual salary. The doctors they recruited were all licensed to practice in Britain. At that time, this was the only requirement for a foreigner to secure a license to practice in Most Canadian provinces.
Soon it became apparent to both governments and public that many of these British doctors were totally unsuitable for practice in Canada. Some had police records, some were drug addicts or alcoholics and some had come for a free trip and for some money to boot.
In spite of government propaganda all truly sick parties were adequately cared for. The doctors worked very hard and without pay. We made house calls and the emergency departments in hospitals were packed 24 hours a day. Some specialists were assigned to rural hospitals to ease the burden on the local physicians.
In the meantime the government became panicky at the turn of events. They enlisted the help of a Noted British conciliator - a Lord Taylor. He arrived in Saskatoon in 48 hours and lived up to expectations. In a matter of a few days he convinced the government to drop the most contentious of their proposals and after more than 3 weeks the doctor's strike was over. The bitterness and ill will remained. Other than the local press the national media as well as the radio and television networks were virulently against the profession. The news items were twisted to give the impression that doctors here didn't give a damn about the welfare of the public but only in selfish money grubbing.
We had been warned that interviews could be doctored to give an opposite view of what was intended. In giving interviews particularly to radio I was extremely careful in what I said and always had another member of our council to back me up.
One Sunday while driving in the car with the radio tuned to the CBC I was appalled at what they did at an interview I gave. Comments I had made were doctored to give a completely different view from what was intended.
Prior to this doctor's strike I probably had the largest practice in Regina of senior NDP beauracrats and politicians. I had the premier and his family. I had several members of the cabinet and their families. There were also many patients who were senior civil servants who after the NDP defeat in the following election drifted to Ottawa where later they became known as the Saskatchewan Mafia.
I was deeply hurt by their desertion. Not only by the shrinking of my practice but also by the lack of loyalty which I felt I deserved. Often years of providing them with medical care.
After the strike we found our finances to be in shambles. All our employees continued to be paid their salaries, rent, utilities, taxes and upkeep had to be paid.
For the first time we had to borrow from the bank to meet our obligations. Moreover the fees we were permitted to charge the insuring agencies were so small that we continued to be hard pressed to meet our obligations for the better part of 3 years.
Our problems were not only due to the strike. In 1963 we were plagued by illness. In March of 1963 I became totally disabled by severe sciatica. I could not sit, I couldn't drive a car. There were only two positions I could maintain. I could stand or lie down. The neurologist I consulted in Regina referred me to the University Hospital in Saskatoon where it was confirmed that I had a herniated disc and surgery was done in April.
I had a very slow convalescence and it was not before the end of May before I was able to return to practice.
During my disability another misfortune struck our little clinic. Mitch Finkelstein suffered a severe pulmonary haemorrhage and required hospitalization. Although we suspected the worst Mitch avoided discussing it and we did not pursue it. We needed help badly and fortunately for us we did manage to get it. Aubrey Matthews originally from Glasgow with his wife and three young daughters were available as well as a young Englishman from Lancashire Jim Concill and his wife. A third doctor a Czech who was completing his internship?

During the period of my disability I became aware that Freda was becoming unusually anaemic. Her doctor referred her to a haematologist at the cancer clinic but his investigation was inconclusive and she was prescribed iron and folic acid.
While I was a patient at the University Hospital in Saskatoon I made an appointment for her to be seen by another haematologist.
She and I spent several days in Saskatoon while the haematologist did innumerable bone marrow smears. Mycloma was suspected but a definite diagnosis could not be confirmed.
On returning to Regina we resumed normal life until tragedy struck the Civkin family in Winnipeg. Freda's mother Celia inadvertently leaned on her stove brushing her dressing gown on a red burner. The material she was wearing was highly flammable and she sustained third degree burns to most of her body. She lasted only a few day before succumbing.
Following the funeral it became Freda's and Sidney's task to help their father adjust to his loss.

?at the Regina General Hospital. He was also married and named Zdenek. Martinovsky. A newly qualified internist Salvador Silva also joined. Then there were others who came and went. An Italian was a good worker but soon left for the States. Then there was a Turk who was a disaster. The best doctor of all was a Peruvian. We knew he wouldn't stay. He had his sights on a more academic career. We were also joined by an Iranian obstetrician gynaecologist an Indian from Guyana an orthopaedist. An extremely successful psychiatrist born in Bombay but educated in England, his name was Charlie Messer. Then there were two Mexicans. A woman called Sophie and a young man Luis Salgado de Leon.
Everyone seemed to be busy and this building was always bulging with activity.
During the fifties I had decided to upgrade my knowledge of electrocardiography. I enrolled in an intensive 3 week course at Chicago's Cook County Hospital. There were many small hotels in the vicinity. I chose one close to the hospital. The course was excellent and I managed to acquire a much clearer grasp of the principle of electrocardiography. The course helped to stimulate me to continue reading and upgrade my skills. Later it became necessary for me to pass examinations at the University of Saskatchewan in Saskatoon to qualify as an electrocardiographer and thereby charge for interpretations. I recall that I studied fairly hard for the exams and managed to pass with a reasonably good mark. This accreditation proved to be very useful as our medical group increased in number.
While In Chicago I managed to get 2 tickets for a concert by Horowitz. We had planned for Freda to join me and after the concert to fly on the New York - which in those days was by far our favourite holiday destination.
But to our profound disappointment when we arrived at the Concert Hall we were greeted with the sad news that Horowitz was ill and could not play.
New York was as exciting as ever. The St. Moritz hotel was to become our home in New York on several subsequent trips.
I notice that I left the sixties and returned to the fifties. I'm sure that there are many other incidents that I neglected to write about and that I'll probably have to backtrack again and again.
Our children were maturing rapidly and their scholastic records could only be described as brilliant. Alex was particularly fortunate in having many friends who collectively could be called a "brain trust". Their marks in high school were in the mid to upper nineties and their competitiveness was very keen. Scholarships were the norm and Alex decided on continuing studying at the University of Saskatchewan in Saskatoon. He and two of his good friends. Dick Groson and Joel Sandonusky rented a new three bedroom apartment. Alex continued to do very well and came to be noticed by Prof. Hilda Neatby of the Department of History. In the meantime David who was equally brilliant at school decided to continue with his passion for architecture. As there was no faculty in Architecture in Saskatoon he decided to go to Winnipeg where he had two sets of grandparents and many second and third cousins via the Pearlman ancestry. By now both boys required cars. Alex bought a tiny British made convertible called a Sunbeam and previously owned by Dr. Gerald Sinclair. He loved the little car and cared for it as for a baby. David got an English Austin which Freda had owned.
Ruthie was still in high school and was doing as brilliantly as her brothers. Her friends continued a close relationship for many years to come.
At graduation Ruthie applied for a scholarship to York University in Toronto. There were 3 scholarships awarded that year to applicants from Western Canada and Ruth was one of them. We were very proud of the children's achievements and felt that they were on the way to achieving professional success.
Not one of them showed the slightest interest in medicine. They had been exposed to the trauma of our "doctors" strike and this unpleasant period in our lives effectively destroyed any temptation they may have had to emulate their father.

To digress:
By nature I'm a pessimist. The passage of time has not altered my instincts.
The world situation seems to confirm this. At my age one cease to worry about one's self. My past has been very eventful and fulfilling. I've had two wonderful wives. My children are a source of pride.
The grandchildren are in their formative years and they too promise to lead productive lives.
So what is the justification form pessimism? Europe has reverted back to its ethnic hatreds. Religion too is nurturing its ancient evils of prejudice, ignorance an superstition. Economists are now back to "free enterprise" which really means freedom for exploitation.
Our politics have become a magnet for incompetents and a means for self enrichment.
The stock market is hitting record highs in spite of more than 1.5 million unemployed and retail sales described by optimists as "sluggish".
The world political situation has been deteriorating steadily since the 1950's and 1960's. The hopes for a European Community or Nations is bogged down by ethnic, cultural and economic problems.
The Soviet Union has been destroyed from within. Ethnic rivalries, old pent up hatreds, civil wars in Georgia and guerrilla war between Armenia and Azerbaijan shows little sign of abatement. In far off Siberia various enclaves clamour for independence and in Tajikistan there have been military uprisings.
The worst of all is in the former Yugoslavia. The situation there is almost too horrible to describe.. The daily reports of random killing, enforced starvation of helpless civilians. The callous destruction of property and history building, torture and rape seem to have become the norm.
Currently there is slaughter in Rwanda as well cholera. All these man made tragedies take a back seat in American Media to the excitement of the cold blooded murder of O.J. Simpson's ex wife and friend..

It is more than a year since I last scribbled my recollections.
Subconsciously I think I know why I stopped writing. Following my convalescence from disc surgery in Saskatoon it became apparent that Freda was far from well. She was seen several times by a haematologist in Saskatoon. For some strange reason the repeated marrow examinations were inconclusive as were bone scans. In Regina she was seen at the Bauer clinic and again went through the gamut of bone scans and bone marrow aspirations. In any event her condition seemed stable and life resumed its normal pattern. We ventured another trip to Europe. We enjoyed ourselves and everything seemed reasonably stable.
On or about 1964 Celia Civkin met a tragic end. While preparing breakfast her night-gown caught fire and after lingering in hospital for a few days she died. Mr. Civkin found it most difficult to adjust; he became deeply depressed and it was obvious that he wouldn't last long. He refused moving into a Senior's home and remained in his small apartment.
It was prevailed that he visit Sidney and Estelle in Vancouver but this trip started out very badly. His plane had to be diverted to another airport because of fog and not paying attention to the announcement by the pilot and instructions by the stewardesses he got out of the plane without his luggage. He spotted a taxi and gave the driver the address. As it happened the town he was in had a street also called Laurel. The old man recognised it as not where his children lived. Apparently a violent argument ensued with the taxi driver. He told the driver to take him back to the airport. In the meantime, Sidney was going berserk looking for his father. Eventually the old man was found and swore that never again would he fly to Vancouver. Some months later he was prevailed upon to visit us in Regina. This trip as well turned out very badly. During one night Freda suffered an agonizing attack of pain in her back. In hospital it was confirmed that she had suffered a collapsed vertebra due to erosion form mycoma. Finally my worst fears were confirmed. The old man realised that Freda was terminally ill. His depression deepened and we all realized that his days were numbered.
With radiation the spinal lesion cleared rapidly but it was necessary for her to wear a brace.
In the mid sixties a new chemotherapeutic drug was developed. It was called Alkeran but its general name was Melphalan. It had been developed in Sweden and its initial report of effectiveness was quite encouraging. Freda took it religiously until her death. As for Civkin - he gradually deteriorated until his death in 1965.
Freda's condition stabilized but her main problem became one of progressive anaemia and kidney failure with uralina. It became necessary for her to be transfused at frequent intervals and to reduce the urnemia - peritoneal dialysis.
In spite of this she was anxious to participate in anything within her physical powers.
Sometime in 1965 or 1966 while General Vanier was nearing the end of his term a s Governor General the Government decided to fund and establish an institute for the promotion of family life to be named in his honour. The Vanier Institute of the Family is quite active to this day.
I am bringing up the Vanier Institute because for some mysterious reason I was nominated to be one of two founding members from Saskatchewan. I was invited to an all expense paid for trip to Ottawa to participate in its founding. Freda came too. We stayed at the Chateau Laurier and attended some magnificent affairs hosted in Govt. House by Madame Vanier. Georges Vanier the G.G. was already seriously ill in hospital. We met and mingled and dined with notables like Dr. Linda Penfield, Allan and Mrs. Bronfman and many others prominent in the business world, politics and academics.
In spite of her frailty Freda enjoyed the affairs and although she had become very thin she looked lovely and friends and acquaintances were hardly aware of the seriousness of her illness. Her trips for hospital admission become ever more frequent. She bore her illness with enormous courage and stoicism. A continuing problem was domestic help. Keeping the house reasonably clean; preparing simple meals, doing laundry and fulfilling simple requests which Freda might request from time to time.
In August 1967 Alex Married Shirley Gould in Regina. The following year David married Ellen Sue Osten of Edmonton. Both affairs went off beautifully. At Alex' wedding we hosted a cocktail party and in Edmonton we had a dinner party in the revolving restaurant at the top of the Chateau Lacombe. Alex was still an undergraduate student at Queen's "U" in Kingston and we did visit them in their tiny apartment. Shirley became a hostess at an afternoon show on a TV station and I tagged along one afternoon to watch her perform and conduct a cooking demonstration. We had no idea that she had such talents. Alex graduated at the top of this call and was awarded the gold medal.
By achieving the gold Alex hoped to get a scholarship to Harvard. He had also applied to NYU and when New York accepted him he accepted. They secured a student apartment in the Washington Square area in a high rise building. He did well and achieved his Master's Degree in Law.
David was doing equally well in Winnipeg in the Faculty of Architecture and always received an annual award sometimes from 2 or 3 sources. He shared a so called apartment on Sherbrooke St. in Winnipeg with another student. His mother and I were shocked to see the squalor in which the boys lived. He didn't seem to mind his environment so we left things as they were. He was also busy with the University productions of their annual Broadway musicals. We went in to see Guys and Dolls at the Playhouse Theatre and enjoyed it very much.
He moved to Toronto where he began to work with an established architect of some repute. It was then that he met Ellen Sue Osten of Edmonton.
Just as Alex went to NYU to get a Master's degree so David requested a little more help t get a Master's degree in Architecture in Toronto. His mentor was Jack Diamond who impressed David immensely and who later achieved architectural prominence in design.
To backtrack a few years. Ruth was awarded a Western Canada Scholarship to York University in Toronto. A brand new building for female students had been erected on campus. She had a very nice room and made many new friends with whom she maintained friendship for many years to come. Her Scholastic Standards remained very high and her scholarships were renewed every year till graduation. She was not content with a BA from York. Consequently she applied to the Law Faculty at U of T and was accepted.
In the meantime I was absorbed with Freda's desperate and deteriorating condition. Her trips by ambulance to the hospital for transfusions and peritonent dialysis became more and more frequent. Her last hospitalization was a very short duration and the children barely made it to her bedside. She died peacefully on July 12th 1969.
She was 53 years of age and she wanted so badly to live. Primarily she worried about Ruthie and she would have been thrilled to see her grandchildren who were still unborn.
Her sister Naomi did not come to the funeral. Her absence was painful to me but I decided to visit Naomi and her husband Bernie who were living in Milwaukee. Ruthie went with me and I think the short visit was good for us. I think it helped to maintain a continuity for the family - particularly for Ruthie.
My first winter alone after Freda's death was a difficult one for me. I had planned on joining a Regina group for a trip to Israel but I became seriously ill with pneumonia and landed in the hospital. My convalescence was slow but eventually I regained my health.
The time began to fly by and when I was told that another group of Regina's was booked for an Israeli tour I immediately "joined".

A really very, very interesting reading, cavfancier, and a piece of lively history!

[We are fortune to have got some dozens of old documents from the past centuries.

Among them, there is a very interesting diary of an great-grandfather of mine (mother's site), who was a head forester for a count.

Yesterday, we found (actually it was "re-found") a letter from 1892, from a great-uncle [father's site] in USA (Sedwick Co., Kansas), where he praised the German community: "Hurrah for the Westphalians in America".

I just finished reading the whole thing. Just fascinating. Are you the son of David, Alex or Ruthie, Cav? (If you don't mind my asking.) When and how did your grandfather die? How did Toots come into the picture?

This is fascinating in and of itself, but especially for me since so much of it mirrors my own grandparents' stories, and even names are duplicated. (My grandmother's family are Robinowitzes.) What a life, and how well told, despite his protestations.

Hinteler, interesting stuff indeed!

sozobe, I am the son of David. Toots was Boris's second wife, after Freda. Boris died about 4 years ago, after a bout of pneumonia (figures, given his story). He had his priorities straight, even while in hospital....he did not give up the ghost until all his children flew in to get last words from him. I attended his funeral, it was the first time I saw my father cry. Toots died not long afterwards, within a year.

sozobe, an interesting side story to Toots: Coincidentally, her name was also Freida (different spelling), but Boris could never bring himself to call her that....hence the nickname. Love eh? Toots was a fantastic lady, true class, and kept Boris happy the rest of his life. Also, Brushka, Boris's mom, was a hefty woman....Mrs. cav was supposed to wear her wedding band, antique Russian gold, for our wedding, but I ended up wearing it instead <img src="http://cdn2.able2know.org/images/v5/emoticons/icon_biggrin.gif" alt="Very Happy"/>

I wore an antique Russian gold necklace (passed down from my grandmother) for my wedding.

One thing I was curious about, Boris talks a lot about how his parents sacrificed to give him an education, but then the rest of his talk of money is about his own family. Do you know if he supported his parents when he became better off?

<post author="cavfancier" datetime="2003-05-01T19:14:00" id="p14">
Boris's dad died before I was born. Brushka lived on for a while, and passed on when I was still young. She was fairly well off...what the situation was in terms of Boris's support, I am not sure. To us, the grandkids, Boris was always prompt but practical with monetary gifts at birthdays and holidays. My mother's parents were more generous, but could also not afford as much as they gave. I still see Boris's approach as subtly teaching the young 'uns the value of a buck. We share a birth sign, as it happens, both Virgos.

Fascinating and in some ways close to home. My Mother came from Bialystock about 1905 and father came from Yalta in 1914. Although my mother told us a few stories about her life in Russian Poland my father never spoke about Russia. One thing I have regretted in my later years is that I never was interested enough to ask questions about their life before coming to this country. That is why aside from it being a wonderful story of your grandfathers journey through life I can identify it with some of my mothers stories. Thank you for the posting it is a gift.

I am totally taken at how well and articulately your grandfather wrote, Cav. I have read almost all of his recollections, and I must say, they rival the Massies' book about Nicholas and Alexandra.

id just simply like to know the general story between the end of the memoirs and the end..
if that doesnt sound too morbid...

like hmm
when and how he met toots <img src="http://cdn2.able2know.org/images/v5/emoticons/icon_question.gif" alt="Question"/>..the memoirs breifly mention he had two wives but says nothing more...
when and how he retired.....
what happened to the building they bought for the practice <img src="http://cdn2.able2know.org/images/v5/emoticons/icon_question.gif" alt="Question"/>
did he ever get to israel <img src="http://cdn2.able2know.org/images/v5/emoticons/icon_question.gif" alt="Question"/>

um thats about it for now i think...

as an aside, i always used to love the stories my grandma told me, when i was young, of growing up in post victorian england (1900-1920) and how poor her family were and the life she had...
sadly she never wrote a thing down, so all i have is the memories, but they'll do for me...

<post author="cavfancier" datetime="2004-11-01T12:19:00" id="p55">
Hmm...Col Man, I'll try to help you out a bit, but honestly, some of the questions I have no answers to. His first wife died in 1969, a year before I was born. By the time I arrived, he was with Toots. How they met, I don't know, but it was most likely at a social event of some sort in Regina. I also don't think he was practicing medicine by the time I was born, and I believe the building they bought for the practice is long gone. However, I do remember watching their home movies as a kid, one at the opening of the clinic, and all the doctors are smoking, drinking and whooping it up. I thought that was pretty funny. They were actually party animals in their day, and regularly kept going from dawn to dusk.
I'm not sure if they ever made it to Israel. Relatives on my mother's side did though.

Being a doctor and a good storyteller, he used to tell his kids, and the grandkids later, made-up fairy tales with characters like King Pellagra and Queen Halitosis. He also enjoyed taking phone calls from patients at dinnertime, and making sure everyone eating could hear him ask questions like "So, what colour was your phlegm again?"

He always encouraged seeking knowledge. If one of the kids had a question, rather than answer it, he always said "why don't we look it up?" The house was always full of books. There were a ton in the basement, and on one visit, when I was just a kid, he asked me to choose whatever I wanted and take them home. This was my first exposure to John Stuart Mill, Locke, Hobbes, and Shirley Jackson (she was one cool witch).

On that same visit, I was in a bug collecting phase. He helped me chloroform them and pin them to corkboards. Then we looked up the Latin names for all the species and labelled them. He introduced me to some rudimentary Latin, I introduced him to ELP, which he found interesting, but not entirely to his taste. That summer, I also trained a stray cat to do tricks, which amused him immensely.

I'll try to remember more, it has been a while. <img src="http://cdn2.able2know.org/images/v5/emoticons/icon_wink.gif" alt="Wink"/>

i remember stories of how in the early part of the century in uk, many docs took heroin(diamorphine), morphine, opium, and laudinum (all opiates) regularly and encouraged others to do so too.. <img src="http://cdn2.able2know.org/images/v5/emoticons/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile"/>

Hi Mike, this is James, son of David, brother of Paul (cav). For some reason, that 1st sentence struck me as rather biblical... I actually saw Uncle Ken a few weeks ago at Alex and Shirley's house in Toronto. Also, not sure if you knew, but I was briefly in touch with Adam while I played and taught on okBridge on-line.

I just got an email from buttercup (Mrs. cav) pointing me in this thread's direction, not knowing what to expect!

Re-reading this thread has been rather emotional, as I'm sure many of you can imagine. I'm actually undergoing major life changes at the moment. We're moving later today (the movers arrive at 1), but I couldn't resist stopping by! I'll try to come by again once we've settled in our new place and I've been at my new job (starting Tuesday) for a bit...

It's an experience I'll remember for the rest of my life, but more importantly cav was one of the very best of humans I've ever met. His intelligence and sensitivity were always apparent in his communication whether it was face-to-face or on a2k/Abuzz.

How to keep my nephews from being taken away?
</headline>
<post author="nelsonm5033" datetime="2011-10-21T18:32:00" id="p1">
I have three nephews that might be taken away from my brother by child services. Apparently they think the parents abused the youngest one who is 4 months old. It all started when my sister takes my nephew to his doctor appointment. The doctor says he has breathing problems and his ribs were fractured (were, healed now thank God) so they take him to the hospital to find out what's wrong and thinks he might have Osteoporosis. They could not find a reason why his ribs were fractured and start to think it's not a medical reason and called child services on the parents.

I know for a fact that my brother did not hurt or abuse the baby in any way, nor the mom. He took care of me since I was a baby and we all live in the same house. I'm not saying the other two nephews (Age 5 and Age 2) have hurt him, I dont want to accuse that the two nephews did it because they're little and young, and what kind of person would I be to blame someone who is still young? They dont know what's going on,and accidents happen, we always watch the little one just in case, we teach the older 2 that their little brother is still a baby. Even the 2 year old understands he's a baby and always wants to kiss him on the cheek, he loves his little brother, we all do. The older 2 play with each other and while someone is holding the little one sometimes they get too close to him and are unaware that they might hurt their little brother. I know for a fact that my older brother who is also like a second father to me (old enough to actually be my father) did not hurt the baby. He's loving and takes care of all of them regardless the state he is in(mentally, physically). How can I convince child services at court that it wasn't abuse so we can keep the babies? I don't want to lose any of my nephews we love them so much. Please someone help me. We all don't want to lose the babies for something we didnt do. Everybody in my family can't stress about this any longer, especially when my mom is sick. I'm just an eighteen year old (youngest) trying to keep my family in place.

@nelsonm5033,

Well, if you have all these facts that you know, that's what you tell the judge.
If you tell him you know something "for a fact" he'll want to know what those facts are.

So what are the facts, or is that just your way of saying you don't believe something?

<post author="nelsonm5033" datetime="2011-10-21T18:41:00" id="p3">
@chai2,

I don't have any hard facts it was my way of saying that he would never do something like that. Sorry for the confusion.
I see my brother with the baby all the time, he never dropped him or hurt him in any way. We were all surprised of what happened to the baby. I just dont know how to convince the judge that we never abused the baby.

Of course the hospital is going to be concerned about a baby with broken ribs but if nobody has done anything wrong (read: intentional) then nobody has anything to worry about.

CPS wants to keep families together.

@boomerang,

I forgot to mention that since the baby is only 4 months old, they can't tell when his ribs were fractured and it's healed now. And we're thinking it was during birth because if it was recent I dont think it would've have been healed.
I hope so because the CPS worker wanted to take the babies on the spot and tried to make my brother signed the paperwork that he neglected/abuse the baby. And this was in the hospital, my brother didnt plan on going today since his wife was there and I the CPS worker didnt inform anybody that she was coming, not even the doctors

I don't want to lose my nephews.

The injury to the child happened when the father had custody. It is his reponsibility to provide a safe home for the children.

Just WHO injured the baby is not the point.

You just briefly mention the mother. What is her take on the issue? How is their marriage?

Your brother can get the children back. He just has to show there is a safe environment. People from the court came to the house. An evaluation was made. Your brother needs to find out what their reports said to make them place the children in another home.

PS - I personally feel the abusive parent should leave the home, not the kids. The wife could have asked for this, if your brother is determined to be the problem. I have a feeling there's more to this situation than you know.

My boyfriend grown up in the Familly
</headline>
<post author="Grazyna" datetime="2011-10-17T07:11:00" id="p1">
Hi,

My boyfriend grown up in the Family. Him and his mother, stepfather and his step siblings and siblings left the cult when he was 7 (but they still stayed in contact and paid money for it for years).

When I started dating him and he told me about his past, I got a bit worried and was looking for some signs of 'damage' in his behaviour. Although I couldn't believe that such a traumatic experience didn't leave any sign in him, I really couldn't see anything being weird or wrong with him.

Not until recently. As we are going out for almost 3 years now, it became important for me that he know, and makes bonds with my family and friends. And here's a problem. He doest seem to understand those bonds at all. He doesn't seem to be able to understand why would I want him to go with mm to my aunts birthday, or to visit my cousin. He doesn't see why would he have to make friends with any of my friends.

I am very close with my family and friends so it really bothers me. He is happy to visit his mum once a year, sisters or brothers whenever they can be bothered to come over and I am not even talking about him not being interested with who his biological father is (at all) - what I also find unsettling.

Could someone explain to me, if that kind of behaviour is any typical for ex-Family members? or maybe it's completely not connected and it's just who he is?

What other dysfunctional behaviour can I expect from my boyfriend in the future?

thank you

@Grazyna,

Hi,

I see there was 12 views. If there are any ex members of The Familly, please tell me what can I expect from my boyfriend. He doesnt like to talk at all, and I really dont know what to think, expect from him, do to help him...

@Grazyna,

There is a Group here on a2k about the family,

see this link: <a href="http://groups.able2know.org/xfamily/">http://groups.able2know.org/xfamily/</a>

You may have to 'register' to participate, but if I remember right, that just involves putting in your a2k username.

@Grazyna,

I think you are looking at this relationship all wrong. Your boyfriend is not damaged. Your boyfriend is not defined or explained by his experiences in this group. If you are going to have a healthy relationship with him, then you need to accept that he is no more damaged than you are.

Have you considered that maybe his point of view is valid? If you can't accept his point of view then you are going to continually have problems. You should forget about his past experiences and focus on your relationship. If you start labeling any of his actions you don't like as "dysfunctional" how are you ever going to have a good relationship?

We all come to relationships with different experiences and "baggage". Either partners learn to accept each other or we move on.

The question about what kind of behavior is typical is meaningless. Humans are all different, you can't categorize someone as an "ex-Family" member any more than you can categorize them as "ex-Catholic" or ex-anything.

A healthy relationship means respecting each other warts and all. Appreciate the things you like, either work through or learn to accept the things you don't like.

This is true of any relationship. Trying to pretend that your relationship is different than any other relationship because of something in your partners past is a very bad idea.

@maxdancona,

Max. do you even know what the poster is talking about? Do you know anything about The Family? I would hardly put the category of "ex-Family" in with "ex-Catholic" - unless perhaps that ex-Catholic suffered from mental and sexual abuse while being forced to practice being a Catholic. Being raised by The Family is similar to being raised in a mental institution and being told you're the one who is not normal. Maybe her boyfriend is fine, but there are also some issues she has a right to be concerned about.

<post author="maxdancona" datetime="2011-10-17T09:38:00" id="p6">
@Green Witch,

That's irrelevant Green Witch. In my opinion it is a problem if there is not mutual respect and acceptance in a relationship.

Look at it from her boyfriend's point of view. Let's say you had something impactful or even traumatic in your past that you shared with your significant other. Would you want him to be judging things you did based on this? Would you want your partner to consider you "dysfunctional" whenever there was a disagreement?

I don't see how a relationship could work this way.

Her boyfriend's past is his past and he gets to deal with it and interpret it any way he wants. It isn't a girlfriend's role to psychoanalyze or judge behavior under any circumstances. If he really has behavior that he feels is dysfunctional (and his opinion is the only one that matters) then he would go a therapist rather than a girlfriend.

I feel strongly that she should support him if he asks for support, and butt out otherwise. And I feel even more strongly that whatever his past, his point of view is just as valid as hers.

The issue here is their relationship. If she can't accept him then their relationship won't work. Blaming it on whatever group or experience he might have had is meaningless.
</post>
<post author="maxdancona" datetime="2011-10-17T10:01:00" id="p7">
Let me clarify a bit.

The OP's complaint is that she wants her boyfriend to be closer to her friends and family. This is a perfectly valid issue. And, it is an issue that is dealt with in millions of couples that have nothing to do with this particular religious group.

They need to deal with it like any other couple deals with it. She needs to express what she needs and she needs to listen respectfully to what her partner needs. She needs to accept his point of view and he needs to accept hers. Then they need to respectfully find the give and take that is core to any healthy relationship.

You can't have a healthy relationship where one partner considers the other partner damaged. Fix-me-up relationships never end well.

There is someone here who is Ex-Family. Maybe that person will see this, and share/post.

@maxdancona,

Max, I can't agree that if someone doesnt ask for help - than don't need help. I personally think that as a girlfriend, I not only have a right but responsibility to try to help my boyfriend if he has some issues.

I did listen to him, I do know his point of view and... I dont know how to name it otherwise ( i know it sounds bad and i wish it didnt <img src="http://cdn2.able2know.org/images/v5/emoticons/icon_smile.gif" alt="Smile"/> ) - he just doesnt behave normal. The guy is nice, friendly, yet he has no ability of... keeping friends? He is very liked at work but outside work he just have no need to see someone for a beer, to visit someone, to talk to someone.

I dont know what do. I know he is not happy about that himself, although he would never say it, but I know that cause i see how sad he gats when i say : U HAVE NOT 1 FRIEND, or I point how he neglect his family.
</post>
<post author="maxdancona" datetime="2011-10-19T19:07:00" id="p15">
@Grazyna,

I am sorry Grazyna, but I can tell you from experience that this isn't going to work. You can't fix someone you are in a relationship with. It is simply impossible.

Put yourself in his shoes. What would you say if someone you were dating decided that you weren't living right and then went around trying to figure out how to change you? You would find it very frustrating to have someone you were involved with judging your life, wouldn't you?

I think it is appropriate for you to mention how you feel and maybe suggest he might get help. As a man I would feel even this was an intrusion. After that you should drop it if your partner doesn't want your "help".

Part of being in a healthy romantic relationship is accepting each other as you are right now. If you can't do this than you shouldn't be together. Relationships where one person is trying to fix the other never work. If your relationship fails, don't blame "The Family".

As I said, there are millions of couples that fall apart because one person wants to fix the other person. I don't know for sure, but I would expect that many other ex-Family people would agree with this.

Hi! Yeah I'd say if you like French then it's definitely worth taking <img src="images/smilies/smile.png"/> If you're even thinking of doing it at uni, I haven't seen anywhere really where you can start it from scratch so think about that <img src="images/smilies/smile.png"/> I didn't find it a massive jump up although you do come on soo much in just a year with grammar, vocab and general speaking. In AS, if you're with AQA you mainly cover topics such as healthy living, families, etc, whereas at A2 it's more to do with the actual world we live in, topics like poverty, crime and punishment, pollution!

No worries! I know it sounds scary but trust me, once you've had a lot of practise and a year of teaching, it's a lot easier <img src="images/smilies/smile.png"/> Is this your GCSE orals? That's exactly what I did, think I actually recorded myself saying the answers and listened back to them! What you're doing is fine, just try to carry on practising as much as you can and if you have anyone at home who can then get them to test you on the questions or test yourself <img src="images/smilies/smile.png"/> Good luck!

Haunted Vacation.
</headline>
<post author="Mycroft" datetime="2012-03-29T23:37:00" id="p1">
My wife and I are about to embark on a little driving getaway that will include a night spent at the famed (for hauntings) Crescent Hotel in Eureka Springs, Arkansas.

We've done things like this before on other vacations, including spending a night at the <a href="http://www.lempmansion.com/">Lemp Mansion</a> in St. Louis, and visiting <a href="http://www.legendsofamerica.com/ks-hauntedatchison.html">Atchison Kansas</a>, supposedly a very haunted town.

We didn't see any ghosts in the Lemp Mansion. I had planned to get up in the middle of the night and look around, but I slept too hard. I suppose the spirits knew of my plan and made me sleep extra hard to thwart me. In Atchison we didn't see any ghosts either, but we took the haunted tour, which involved driving around town and having the tour guide point to really old buildings that were supposedly haunted, and we took a tour of a supposedly haunted victorian era home, which I'm pretty sure the owners just made up the ghost stories so they could charge tourists $5 a head and help them pay a mortgage that was maybe a bit more than they could comfortably handle.

For the record, I don't believe in ghosts. My wife is a bit more open to the idea, but has become a lot more skeptical in the years we've been together. Really we just like to drive around, visit little towns, civil war sites, and stupid tourist attractions.

If I find any evidence of the paranormal, I'll certainly post it here.

Oh yeah, we might also visit a site that's frequently visited by UFO's. I forget where that is exactly, the wife is in charge of the travel plans.

Be sure to report back, would love to hear about it.

I've long thought that a website that catalogued all these places would be a fun skeptic project. I love to do side-trips when I travel for business, but often don't have time to do a ton of research. It would be cool to be able to look up potential skeptic tourism sites on a site based on where I'm going.

I imagine it would end up being very much like the UK site <a href="http://www.nerdydaytrips.com/">Nerdy Day Trips</a>, especially the part where they let readers add new sites.

Paranormal tourism is getting to be a huge deal. Ghost tours and monster festivals are EVERYWHERE. They are great fundraising tools for historic societies.

That said, it's bugging me. Almost ALL sites have manufactured stories of things that happened. I think it does a disservice to society to pass these stories off as real AND connect them to paranormal occurrences. I wish there was a skeptical ghost tour that taught you history and folklore from a skeptical bent. If I lived in Gettysburg, this would make a great side business. However, there are about 15 ghost tours and attractions in that town already...

I'm at a loss as to why you'd need to add a ghost story to Gettysburg to make it interesting. They did the same thing to Williamsburg, VA. It vexed me.

I think the ghost tours would be far more exciting if the hotel owners actually pretended to be haunted by some specter, only to have the ghost unmasked by some pesky kids and their dog at the end of the tour!

I spend a lot of time in historic properties dating from the 12th century onwards. When I trained at Historic Scotland (a very, very long time ago) I got to work on chambered cairns and the like.

Never once have I seen anything remotely paranormal and eldritch.

That said, you'll find that most people surveying such buildings on their own listen to their MP3 players, otherwise the mind can play the odd funny trick on you.

For my recent 40th birthday celebration we went to Salzburg where, in addition to going to the BEST beer haul EVER we also had lunch at Saint Peter's, the oldest operating restaurant in Europe. It's been serving guests since 803. The menu has been updated a few times since then of course. Charlemagne ate there in 807. We asked to be seated at the same table but there was some confusion on that point.

Vampire in NC
</headline>
<post author="burmballgeetar" datetime="2012-03-15T12:30:00" id="p1">
Perhaps you guys could help me out...I work in a bar in Southeast NC and apparently we had a vampire in for karaoke and line dancing. As a reformed Bigfoot bleever myself, when I was told some stories, I immediately started to wonder how a person could pull off such a wonderful hoax.

Among the best anecdotes were the ones from our DJ. She apparently was the center of his attention for a while. Explaining away strangely colored eyes or complexion is as easy as saying make up and contacts but I was dumbfounded by one comment in particular.

She said that she watched his teeth extend into fangs. I don't in any way, shape or form believe that this individual was an actual vampire but I also don't believe that our DJ was lying to me. Does anyone know if there is an appliance of some sort or maybe even a small mechanical device that would work for actually extending teeth into fangs? Easy enough to do on film but in reality it seems a bit difficult.

Actually, it's quite easy to say you saw someone's teeth extend into fangs-let me show you:

" I saw someone's teeth extend into fangs! "

See?

I know one way but it may only work for me.
I am missing my middle teeth, lost them in a fight at 16. I wear a partial denture.
I can smile, then close my mouth and slip the dentures into the back of my mouth. When I smile slowly again, I can make it appear my "fangs" (eye teeth) are growing longer. I can then slip my partial plate back in and show them normal teeth again.

I'm not going to tell the DJ she's an idiot. That's rude. I appreciate the help in finding this product LTC8k6.

Also, in my experience she is an honest person and wouldn't lie about this just for the sake of lying. It makes more sense to me that she saw this dental appliance.

I can't answer one way or another about whether this worked for him or not but I imagine there are enough folks who would fall for it. Twilight/True Blood/Anne Rice fans would go stupid for it with the right prep and actually, being next to Camp Lejeune and all the Marines means that there are plenty of jacked up trucks.

Just another thought, it's very easy for us to sucumb to suggestion, depending on the situation. Tricks of lighting, unreliable memory (which we all have), and numerous other factors come into play. She may truly believe she saw the teeth grow, whether an appliance was used or not. I still have a firm, definate memory of three men in tuxedos and top hats (carrying canes) waking me up from the bottom bunk in my bedroom when I was about 5 years old (it was actualyl my Dad trying to wake me to watch a Godzilla movie on TV, that I had special permission to wake up for. I missed it <img src="http://forums.randi.org/images/smilies/frown.gif"/> ).

So she well may be neither an idiot nor lying...she may simply be human.

Sounds like some chump may wake up with a wooden stake through his heart sometime... Yep, it's all fun and games till somebody gets a stake through the heart. Meanwhile, does the bar have a mirror? Most bars I've been to have big mirrors behind them. Growing teeth are one thing, lack of reflection is another.

Hmm, the way the thing zips by makes me think it's close, and therefore kind of small. On slow-mo it looks rather blurry, so perhaps it's moving fast relative to the camera, too fast to record details. Thus the cigar shape is probably an artifact. A bird, perhaps? (Before the animation started I thought the object of interest would be the saucer-shaped sports facility on the ground, which really would have been freaky.)

I have lived in Dallas for 19 years and worked nights for the vast majority of them. I work outside about half the time and go outside for smoke breaks quite frequently. I always watch the sky as I'm a naked eye enthusiast and would love to sight a UFO that had the appearance of an alien spacecraft. In all those years of skywatching, I have never seen anything that looked like an ET or that I couldn't identify shortly after posting my observation to JREF (see my thread "What did I see" - turned out to be an Iridium flare).

eta - I can't even tell what part of the Metroplex that is, and the only really interesting aspect of the video is that it resembles a "rod" which we all know are insects, but it's moving in the same direction as the plane and is clearly much faster. I'm not aware of any insects that fly at 2-3000 feet and at what I assume is 200 mph.

I'd go with digital artifact rather than what it otherwise looks like - the Silver Surfer.

Yeah, the fact that it's outrunning the plane makes my bird theory kind of dumb, unless the Mythbusters are at it again with their frozen chicken cannon. Given the general blobbiness of the image, I'd say a reflection or other optical artifact is probably a pretty viable theory.

1. Considering the objects' speed, they look too crisp. There should be more motion blur.
2. The first object's orientation is not aligned with its flight path but it is tilted upwards.
3. The objects move in straight lines. This would look odd if the camera was shaking. But luckily, the camera shake just so stops right before the first object enters. Like the UFO waited till the camera stabilization or the post-production deshaking hit in. How convenient!
4. The uploader did a frame-by-frame analysis, yet somehow overlooked the second object. That, or he just inserted the second object as bait for viewers to find it and get all excited about it.

It's just images swept linearly across the video frames.

From the Patty/BobHeironimus Bigfoot thread:

<quote orig_author="doctoratlantis">
I just posted a new podcast called " <a href="http://www.monstertalk.org">MonsterTalk</a> " - available at MonsterTalk.org. Our first episode is an interview with Dr. Todd Disotell, the NYU professor with a mohawk who did the DNA analysis for the MonsterQuest (and in total about 30) "bigfoot samples".

Our next guest is going to be Michael McLeod, author of the new book "Anatomy of a Beast". It tells the story of Ivan Sanderson, Patterson, and the birth of the Bigfoot Legend. (Although I'm sure MANY of the readers of the JREF forums will know most of these details, and perhaps dispute them.) Still, ya might enjoy the show. We certainly got a lot of interesting info out of Dr. Disotell.

Hope y'all like it - you're the target audience.

From the website:

<quote>
Episode 001 of Monster Talk.
Our panel (Ben Radford, Dr. Karen Stollznow and Blake Smith) interview Professor Todd Disotell, PhD. Todd has been a guest on multiple television shows to examine potential Bigfoot and Yeti DNA. We ask him about the science of DNA analysis, his thoughts on cryptid-TV, and what he?s found in his studies.

Questions include :

How did Todd get involved in cryptid DNA analysis?

How does DNA get culled from contaminants?

What have Todd?s findings been so far?

What was his take on the DNA from the Monster Quest ?Sasquatch Attack? episode?

What would Bigfoot DNA actually look like?

How big was Giganto and what does a primatologist think of the ?Giganto Hypothesis? to explain Bigfoot?

What does ?unknown? mean in DNA analysis?

Blake (Doctor Atlantis), I like that you guys mentioned that admitted hoaxer Paul Freeman (deceased) deserves his own show. I was recently banned from a Bigfoot forum and one of the things that contributed to that was discussing Paul Freeman's hoaxing in a thread devoted to his cast collection. It was strange because enthusiasts were discussing his hoaxing in a dismissive manner before me. The owner of the forum (Melissa Hovey - Bigfoot/UFO enthusiast) just wrote off anything ever submitted by Bigfootery figure Doug Bilby (Bullet Maker), yet in complete contradiction supported Freeman material (I surmise because of support by Jeff Meldrum). I don't think they liked that I pointed out that Freeman's cast collection represented at least 26 individual Bigfoots (showing absurd variation) found in his area.

You were right in pointing out the high numbers of reports in WA, OR, CA, and FL. For future reference 2/3 of sightings are outside the west coast. You guys mentioned Florida but I just wanted to point out (BFRO database, same as you guys used)...

Run down with Todd for those with little time...

How did Todd get involved in cryptid DNA analysis?

Many of Todd's colleagues knew of his work with the evolutionary genetics of primates including extracting DNA from hair samples. Todd says his lab had identified some subspecies of chimpanzees and gorillas. Jeff Meldrum gave him his first hair sample which was negative. Negative means no DNA present (several "Bigfoot" samples he tested) or from a known source. He says that most of the samples come back as human (he also mentions samples that were pig, bear, and not even biological). He says he continued to take samples from Meldrum and associates more out of courtesy to a friend and fellow anthropologist but always expressed skepticism regarding Bigfoot.

What have Todd?s findings been so far?

Todd says he's personally processed about 30 samples in the last 15 years with not a single thing being something other than what could be Bigfoot. And that he no longer will do samples without some good reason to do the test.

How does DNA get culled from contaminants?

Todd says that for primatological work that feces are the main source for samples he has worked with. He says he uses <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PCR">Polymerase chain reaction</a> (PCR) procedure and chemical re-agents as PCR primers that will only amplify primate DNA or even mammal DNA versus bacteria DNA.

(I like here that Todd comments on the waste of resources, time, and equipment just to show that a scat was bear poo.)

What was his take on the DNA from the Monster Quest ?Sasquatch Attack? episode?

"How to be polite here?" He stresses that 1 base difference is still completely modern human. That he said the sample was completely modern human was edited out. He suspects laboratory contamination which happens very often because testing methods are so sensitive. Todd says that MonsterQuest constantly edits out critical statements.

What would Bigfoot DNA actually look like?

Todd thinks this is an intellectually interesting question. He said he's sampled many things from Australia, the Himalayas, and North America. He mentions the Giganto hypothesis and whether it would result in something related to Orangutan. He also mentions the remnant Homo hypothesis and the idea of Bigfoot as a relict neanderthal. He says he has multiple colleagues with labs similar to his who refuse to work with Bigfoot enthusiasts but having an agreement with those labs that if he ever found something interesting, such as a sequence related to the orangutan line, that he could send the sample on to those labs with the simple instruction "sequence this" without saying anything else. He says if two labs came back with a result showing a relation to the orangutan line but not orang, that he would consider it an important finding (IOW reliable evidence).

Todd says that he is a tenured professor and that he could never be fired for dabbling in "fun stuff". Karen Stollsnow quotes him from Scientific American as saying that he goes along with it because he's either doing good science, finding alternatives, debunking, or making find of the century.

Todd says he has no problem doing it but that his main problem is with the Bigfoot proponents is that they are trying to prove something which is not what science is. He says that because they are trying to prove the existence of Bigfoot, they are inherently biased in everything they do. He says that all they can do is disprove things, removing all the junk and dealing with what's left over. He says that proof that Bigfoot doesn't exist is an impossibility. He says anyone who is out there with the agenda to prove the existence of Bigfoot has immediately lost true scientific credibilty. He says such people might find scientists to work with but that it doesn't qualify what they are doing.

He says he doesn't have a problem with those who search for Bigfoot. Todd shares a funny anecdote about how he has a map of the US with area codes next to his office phone and that he won't accept calls coming to him from certain area codes (most of the PNW and wide swathes of South). BTW, Todd says as a hunter he's found bear and coyote skeletons.

How big was Giganto and what does a primatologist think of the ?Giganto Hypothesis? to explain Bigfoot?

He says he has trouble with a 9ft Bigfoot. He says he doesn't think Gigantopithecus was 9ft and probably not much bigger than 6ft. He thinks Giganto's teeth and jaws were so big simply because of their primary food source (bamboo).

(Note: Please no silly questions about pandas. Pandas are not primates and do not have primate adaptions but rather bear adaptions.)

What does ?unknown? mean in DNA analysis?

Inconclusive means "nothing". He says that he's never been unable to identify a sequence of DNA when DNA was present. He indicates that it in no way necessarily equates that Bigfoot is in anyway indicated

What size of a population do you need for a viable genetic group to live?

Todd says many hundreds. He can't accept the idea of having like, 3 Bigfoot in one area or a tiny number per state. He thinks the variable toe number issue with Bigfoot is bizarre.

I really like Todd. Apparently his facebook quote is "Everybody believes in something. I believe I'll have another beer."

I think the most important thing is that Blake, Ben, and Karen facilitated a change of perception where I had no idea what Todd Disotell was thinking or what ideas he prescribed to, to allowing me to examine his real thoughts and knowledge and learn that I'm very much behind him as a skeptic.

BTW, opening and closing music was by the Peach Stealing Monkies.

I am telling you this not as a personal attack but as someone whose been very patient with you, given you positive advice both in PM and in-thread, and tolerated your flailing, by your own admission sometimes drunken, behaviour. You are acting like an idiot. I'm not saying you are an idiot. But here on the JREF you certainly act like one. Not just an idiot but a lazy idiot. A jackass, a fool, a moron, or an imbecile. Any word you choose to appropriately convey to you that when you flail, drink and post, read tiny snippets of posts and then tommygun spray replies that you didn't spend any time thinking about longer than the moment it popped up in your head, that it makes you look very foolish, lazy, and very much a nuisance.

Is that why you're here? To be a nuisance? Do you want hundreds of people thinking you are an idiot and an irritation? I don't think so but that is exactly what is happening. Think about this now - everytime someone sees the handle "makaya325", they expect idiocy. They expect high frequency flatulence. You told me before that you want try and make positive contributions and gain some respect. You are doing the complete and exact opposite. You are flouting every bit of advice I've given you and insisted on acting foolish and lazy.

I'm am telling you this now and now only, little mak. I have never put anyone on ignore. Not Sweaty, not Lyndon, not log, not Creekfreak, not historian. You are going to be the first. You are going to be the very first person in over three years of my time at JREF that I put on ignore. It will not be because you are rude or foul. I can handle that. I will put you on ignore because of the sidetracking and flailing stupidity and laziness that is in your posts. You post like a 16 year old girl with a cell phone, you can't quote to save your life, you couldn't read your way out of a airplane washroom, and you write like you use alphabet fridge magnets for reference. I'm not kidding, I got an email from a Nigerian scammer yesterday that was written better than your posts.

I don't think this is the way you want to go. I'm telling you once and once only. One more fart post where you have clearly not read what the person wrote to whom you are responding and you will no longer exist to me. I will see nothing but your handle and not your posts and I will be glad I do not have to read garbage posts or expend another single second of effort trying to help someone who inssist on acting like an idiot and refusing to make any personal growth.

Got it? One warning, that's it, and then you can enjoy the attentions of only those who haven't been as patient as I.

Why don't you listen to the show, think about what you're hearing, and consider what you're writing before posting so that you don't make posts that present you as being lazy and dull? You can also read what I took the time to make available for everybody, including intelligent people who don't have enough free time to listen to the whole show. I do that, little mak, as a courtesy to my fellow forum members who I think will actually read what I wrote, appreciate the effort it took me to do that, and make informed contributions to the discussion based on what was said and written.

That show and what I wrote about it will give you a very good idea of exactly what has gone on up to date concerning tests looking for Bigfoot DNA. Todd Disotell describes exactly what is involved and how it is done. He makes clear that fellow anthropologist and colleague, Jeff Meldrum, has relied on Disotell to test any material that Meldrum had any hope of yielding positive results. Your question shows that you have no interest in actually being informed but instead are bent on holding out hope and searching for some possibility that Bigfoot may exist.

15 years, 30 tests done by Disotell personally, every single result negative. If there ever were matching tests that were within the parameters that he specified, it would be an absolute safe bet that both he and his Bigfoot proponent colleague Meldrum would know about it.

Remember, little mak, only one last chance to exist anywhere in my universe.

What on Earth are you talking about? Where is there a claim by Meldrum that he hasn't found or submitted any hair samples?

You must realize that you look like you have no clue what you are talking about. You must understand that in my eyes, you are covering this thread with stupid.

3) If you answered "no" and don't have a clue what you're talking about, and considering what I just said about your last chance with me, why shouldn't I put you on ignore?

Meldrum said, very clearly, in the article you linked to, that hair that has been found by other Bigfoot researchers is not reliable as Sasquatch hair, since there is no verified sample of Sasquatch hair for comparison. Finding hair in the woods is not unusual. What would be unusual is if it were proven to be Sasquatch hair-which, at this point, cannot be done.

Are you talking about this quote?
"Memo: Bigfoot trackers also have found hair in the wilds. Meldrum said it is hard to classify it, since there is no identified Sasquatch hair for comparison. "

Whatever you're talking about, BF:LMS has a lot of info on hair. On page 262 Meldrum talks about a 1993 analysis by Dr. Sterling Bunnell, M.D. - at that time you couldn't get DNA from hair. Bunnell suggested that some samples from Northern California were in the "human-chimpanzee-monkey" group. But note that included "human" - and at least as far as Disotell's testing has gone, none of the samples he's gotten have come back as mysterious primate.

Has Meldrum followed up with Bunnell? Dunno.

There is DNA in the core of the hair. That's why it's an advance in science. It's been an available technique for a couple of years - I heard about it first on the "Skeptics Guide to the Universe" podcast.

Well - as Disotell pointed out, having the evidence contaminated does NOT mean that he couldn't find Bigfoot DNA if it was in there. In fact, it sounds pretty easy. If they got the DNA - which would certainly be in the feces or blood (and possibly hair) if it were collected as a fairly new sample - then his lab could tell which part of the sample was a human contaminant and which was unknown primate. (or Giant Sloth or Bear or whatever...)

That was something I learned. Contaminated DNA evidence of Bigfoot is not worthless. But to date none of the samples have had any mystery primate in them.

I base it on the fact that many Bigfoot hairs, most which are biological, have failed to yield any usable DNA, compared to scat and blood.

Remember monsterquest? Disotell could not extract the dna out of the hair due to not discarding the Inhibitor. Nelson had no problem identifying the blood when he Looked for DNA in it, due to the fact that he removed the inhibitor.

Well - as Disotell pointed out, having the evidence contaminated does NOT mean that he couldn't find Bigfoot DNA if it was in there. In fact, it sounds pretty easy. If they got the DNA - which would certainly be in the feces or blood (and possibly hair) if it were collected as a fairly new sample - then his lab could tell which part of the sample was a human contaminant and which was unknown primate. (or Giant Sloth or Bear or whatever...)

That was something I learned. Contaminated DNA evidence of Bigfoot is not worthless. But to date none of the samples have had any mystery primate in them.

What blew me away was how advanced the technology has become. When he was discussing having the entire genomes of humans, chimps, gorillas, mice, rats, sheep, and most for orangutans on his laptop I was like...

It really drove home for me that there is absolutely nothing out there either to the knowledge of Disotell or Meldrum that could be even considered "maybe Bigfoot".

Well, that's a pretty stupid thing to do, isn't it? 18 year old kid questions the veracity of NYU genetic sequencing expert and anthropologist, Prof. Todd Disotell's assertaion that with the current technology DNA can be extracted from hair missing a root roughly 50% of the time because of the fact that some alleged Bigfoot hairs have failed to yield usable DNA.

Remember monsterquest? Disotell could not extract the dna out of the hair due to not discarding the Inhibitor. Nelson had no problem identifying the blood when he Looked for DNA in it, due to the fact that he removed the inhibitor.

And that even partials could be verified by comparing to different sections of the genome for confirmation.

The big thing that the show dispelled was the thing that has been chucked around by footers where they said Nelson's findings seemed to indicate Bigfoot when they showed nothing other than completely modern human. The point where you guys replayed Nelson boldly announcing that he now thinks he may have sasquatch DNA just had me shaking my head. Disotell stressed that were talking about variation on the level of Doctor Atlantis and kitakaze, not on the order of genera.

Thanks and yeah, I agree that bringing it down to snippets sort of defeats the purpose. It's the whole discussion that needs to be heard. I went from not being quite sure what to make of Disotell to completely understanding where he was coming from, what his position was regarding Bigfoot, various evidence claims, and hypotheses. I also found that I might have thought he was a bit of a weirdo before and now I think he's a very cool and interesting scientist.

It's like you could go watch a Motorhead show with him and drink 8 pints and then he'd stumble up and say "gotta... primatological... polymerase... cat food... morning" *belch* And the next day he'd be drinking coffee and going over gene sequences for gibbons.

Sweet baby Jesus on burnt toast, I have really had enough of this...

Little mak, do you realize how tiring this gets? Do you have any idea how lame it gets when you come and lay these big stinky dumps right in the middle of detailed and intelligent conversations among adults? Holy crap, would you just reaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaad what is in front of you before you whip your shorts down and let fly? Look at this, little mak. Look above at the way you quoted me and below at what you left out that quote:

I am telling you this not as a personal attack but as someone whose been very patient with you, given you positive advice both in PM and in-thread, and tolerated your flailing, by your own admission sometimes drunken, behaviour. You are acting like an idiot. I'm not saying you are an idiot. But here on the JREF you certainly act like one. Not just an idiot but a lazy idiot. A jackass, a fool, a moron, or an imbecile. Any word you choose to appropriately convey to you that when you flail, drink and post, read tiny snippets of posts and then tommygun spray replies that you didn't spend any time thinking about longer than the moment it popped up in your head, that it makes you look very foolish, lazy, and very much a nuisance.

Is that why you're here? To be a nuisance? Do you want hundreds of people thinking you are an idiot and an irritation? I don't think so but that is exactly what is happening. Think about this now - everytime someone sees the handle "makaya325", they expect idiocy. They expect high frequency flatulence. You told me before that you want try and make positive contributions and gain some respect. You are doing the complete and exact opposite. You are flouting every bit of advice I've given you and insisted on acting foolish and lazy.

I'm am telling you this now and now only, little mak. I have never put anyone on ignore. Not Sweaty, not Lyndon, not log, not Creekfreak, not historian. You are going to be the first. You are going to be the very first person in over three years of my time at JREF that I put on ignore. It will not be because you are rude or foul. I can handle that. I will put you on ignore because of the sidetracking and flailing stupidity and laziness that is in your posts. You post like a 16 year old girl with a cell phone, you can't quote to save your life, you couldn't read your way out of a airplane washroom, and you write like you use alphabet fridge magnets for reference. I'm not kidding, I got an email from a Nigerian scammer yesterday that was written better than your posts.

I don't think this is the way you want to go. I'm telling you once and once only. One more fart post where you have clearly not read what the person wrote to whom you are responding and you will no longer exist to me. I will see nothing but your handle and not your posts and I will be glad I do not have to read garbage posts or expend another single second of effort trying to help someone who inssist on acting like an idiot and refusing to make any personal growth.

Got it? One warning, that's it, and then you can enjoy the attentions of only those who haven't been as patient as I.

I am now trying to arrange a trip to Yakima to meet and interview Bob Heironimus. I plan to record the interview(s) as well as take various measurements such as head, height, arm and leg lengths and see if I can get images of him from the period of his participation with Roger's film.

Until recently the main issue was contacting Heironimus without involving people such as Long or Biscardi who have a history with him. That has been resolved and it really comes down to just getting the time to set things in motion. I plan to put everything recorded on youtube as a series of videos. I'm shooting for before the end of August. I have no reason to think that Heironimus wouldn't be quite willing to participate.

On a similar subject, <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=SN5ticlIAt4C&amp;lpg=PA69&amp;ots=1BC7S4dZZL&amp;dq=%22bob%20gimlin%22%20%22new%20york%22%20indian&amp;pg=PA69">I found something related to Wallace's claims of helping Roger Patterson</a>. Granted, I've never gave much weight to this particular claim of his, but I still thought that others here might be interested in seeing it.

That said, I have no reason to doubt that Wallace faked all the tracks that proponents try to explain away

And I want to ask him about Ivan Sanderson's experience with hoaxes.

</quote>
If you ever get the chance, you should try contacting Dr. Roy P. Mackal. Story goes that he confronted Sanderson about an error in one of his alleged sightings and got him to confess that he made up all of personal cryptid encounters in his books. Sanderson allegedly said something to the effect of that he "loved to eat lobster" and included such hoaxes in his books to boost sales enough to let him eat more of it. I would love to know whether or not this is true.

Oh, and <a href="http://www.kean.edu/~bregal/docs/Annals66.1.pdf">this</a> could come in handy if you decide to discuss Dr. Grover Krantz.

I am now trying to arrange a trip to Yakima to meet and interview Bob Heironimus. I plan to record the interview(s) as well as take various measurements such as head, height, arm and leg lengths and see if I can get images of him from the period of his participation with Roger's film.

See if you can get him to provide any pre-PGF home movies that show doing the Patty walk. Also, you might want to look into the claims made <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Patterson-Gimlin_film">here</a> and <a href="http://forums.randi.org/archive/index.php/t-40576-p-6.html">here</a> (in a LAL post made on 12th August 2005, 07:31 PM)

That has been resolved and it really comes down to just getting the time to set things in motion. I plan to put everything recorded on youtube as a series of videos. I'm shooting for before the end of August. I have no reason to think that Heironimus wouldn't be quite willing to participate.

It's a good show. You improved the production and sound quality.

I noticed at least a couple of errors...

"Dummies Guide" to PGF states that they tracked her for 3 miles. The reported distance is actually 3.5 miles.

You say Bob Heironimus is "one of several" (or similar words) when you are introducing him as the guy who confessed. BH is actually the only person ever to publicly confess to wearing the suit.

Thoughts on episode #2...

Wow! The first show was excellent and this second installment has ironed the slight wrinkles (Karen's not in a can anymore) and really improved the presentation quality. I like the can of worms bit. I can't stress enough how much I love the Peach Stealing Monkeys intro. Here is a PSM reworking of Nat King Cole's <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TiNJnsOh5So">Nature Boy</a>. I really like Blake's idea of having the show avoid dating itself with crypto news but nevertheless...

OMG! <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taco_Bell_chihuahua">Gidget</a> the Taco Bell dog dropped the chalupa!

Karen did a great job recounting the PGF popular version of events. I think Karen with her Aussie inflections is the only person I've ever heard make the word "Bigfoot" sound sexy. If I were recounting the popular version of events, I might have mentioned the inconsistency of whether Patterson was thrown and pinned by his horse or cleanly dismounted while extracating his camera. Also, there is Gimlin's testimony that he didn't remain on his horse but rather dismounted, held his horses reins, and held his rifle (not pointed at Patty).

Minor quibble - Blake states at 11:20 that besides Bob Heironimus, multiple people have claimed to be Patty. There's no one else who's ever made that claim. Karen mentions that BH was a neighbour of Bob Gimlin's and Blake mentions that they were friends. They live nine houses away on the same street. Nice job mentioning the wild coincidences with the book and illustrations.

What I found most valuable from this show in particular was knowing that McLeod interviewed Gimlin personally in which Gimlin indicated that Patterson might have tricked him and yet McLeod himself seemed to not be aware of the well publicizes quote where Gimlin states that he's an older man now and concedes he might have been tricked.

What I love most about Monster Talk in general is that it makes skepticism and critical thinking cool. So much crypto gobbledy-gook is delivered in a sleek package á la MonsterQuest and tries to suspend people's disbelief with slick pseudo-scientific hooey so it's great to have a resource to counter it. Blake, Ben, and Karen make a great trio and the work and effort they put into this show is greatly appreciated by me and people like myself.

Excellent job on #2, guys, and looking very much forward to #3. <img src="http://forums.randi.org/images/smilies/smile.gif"/>

Glen Kuban ( <a href="http://paleo.cc">http://paleo.cc</a> ) has done extensive research on two cases important to monster enthusiasts. His article explaining the true nature of the ?mysterious? carcass netted by the Japanese fishing vessel Zuiyo-maru and his decades long investigation into the alleged ?giant humanoid tracks? in the Paluxy fossil bed in Texas both highlight the importance of a thorough investigation before assuming the remarkable is true. In the case of the Zuiyo-Mary, the carcass bore a preliminary similarity to plesiosaur remains ? an animal which should have been extinct for millions of years.

And in the case of the Paluxy tracks, the appearance of hominid tracks fossilized along-side dinosaur tracks would have given young-earth creationists a potential falsification for the theory of evolution. Glen examined that case and his work revealed that the tracks were not those of a prehistoric giant people ? instead, weathered dinosaur tracks led to an interesting confrontation with the young-earth creationists.

Our next guest is a paleontologist who specializes in prehistoric aquatic reptiles like the plesiosaur. I'm hoping he'll be able to tell us MUCH more about what we'd actually expect to see if such animals were still alive today. I suspect there are good arguments against the existence of such animals being alive today beyond "they're supposed to be dead".

I think a lot of cryptozoologists characterize the arguments against plesiosaurs being alive today as "knee-jerk denial" and don't consider factors such as temperature, diet, reproductive strategies, etc... that work against the plausibility of "the plesiosaur hypothesis."

Be warned that they (or at least some of them) may say you are outdated and accuse you of sloppy research. Lake monsters are nowadays seen by some cryptofolks as mammals (its easy to find Coleman's rants on this at Cryptomundo).

IMHO its nothing but a feeble attempt to increase the critters' plausibility, since real mammals must also breath, eat, poop, breed and die, thus leaving traces of their reality other than blurry pics...

BTW, speaking about cryptodumbness, one must not forget that the proposed Cadborosaurus sea serpents are supposed to be reptiles with gills or able to breath through hairs...

Naish's article shows pretty well that the Cadborosaurus paper is a joke when it comes down to science. Use a pic (and a poor quality one) to describe a species is far from being sound. Especially when you can not rule out the hoax possibility.

And, as usual in cryptozoology, the pic's quality and detail level in no way can support the interpretations from LeBlond and Bousfield.

I forget where I read this, but I recall reading that it was felt that plesiosaurs' necks probably would have evolved to hang down more (and thus not be able to rise them up in the manner that pop culture depicts them) so they'd have easier access to the bottom-dwellers they feed on.

Most American cryptozoologists, from the beginning, and, indeed, most critical thinking cryptozoologists today reject The Plesiosaur Hypothesis. The mammalian focus and other schools of thought have won out long ago. We realize that these extinct marine reptiles are extinct, and to promote or use them as candidates for Loch Monsters is done mostly by "true believers" (on both sides of the aisle, whether they are pro- or anti-Nessites).

Oh that's easy, Donald Trump's office. But since your main concern was where and not when, there's the bad news. It won't be available for another 65 million years. Humanity still needs to destroy itself and then collide with an asteroid and then have a re-birth and...and yada yada yada 65 million years from now, that world's Donald Trump? will again inexplicably have riches beyond belief, but will posses something the present day Donald doesn't, fully mature genes. Ones which will allow him the ability to get a better hairdresser and to actually pay his bills. And wa-la, you'll get paid. <img src="http://forums.randi.org/images/smilies/wink.gif"/>

So anyway...

Nessie (Champ, Ogopogo et al) being long extinct prehistoric reptiles just never made a lot of sense, mostly because being extinct for like 65 million years (65 with 6 zeros) should pretty much on it's face be enough contradictory evidence for anyone seriously considering they could actually still exist. Now, present day reptiles such as a monster snake, or some kind of monster amphibian etc. do make some sense. Otters notwithstanding, the plausibility there are actual creatures causing all the commotion in these lakes has to be pegged at at least 'fair to middlin'. IMO, more than that of the existence of Bigfoot. I would not be shocked to find out Nessie and Friends? really are otters.

Guess I'll have to make a thread with a probability study about the events you described at the first paragraph of the above post. Don't worry, I'll take numbers out of my digestive system's rear end which will create a favorable result.

Many things can account for lake &amp; sea monsters sightings. Otters, seals, sturgeons, boat/ship wakes, even seagulls (an alleged San Francisco sea serpent video shows seagulls), etc.

When it comes down to lakes (and especially lakes with lots of people around), such a small areas are unlikely to hold unknown large animals. Now, if I were to build a plausible lake monster, I would use one of those japanese giant salamanders as a model. No need to surface every now and then to breath, thus decreasing odds of being sighted, and can live at cold waters. Their relatively low metabolism would also be another help on the few sightings problem- they would not be very active. However, this brings little if any relief to the fact that a viable, breeding population would not fail to leave reliable evidence of its presence. Remember- we're taking about 50 to 500 breeding specimens of large predatory animals living at a lake.

Here's something I made a few months ago- my own blobby blurry sea monster pics, taken at Guanabara bay, Rio de Janeiro. Lets call her Bessie. I took these pics of Bessie while at a cab, using a cell phone camera; her size was estimated as 3 meters or so. Typical sea/lake monster sighting. Red circles, über zoomed cropped areas and fantasy interpretation as courtesy. Note that the very picture was already cropped.

I could have created a more detailed standard "sighting report", but my point is that ordinary objects can be and are being sold as sea monsters. If the pic were not blurry...

Ordinary objects are also being misidentificated; this very object gave me that split-second impression of a nessie. Its not hard to imagine that many sightings, especially the short ones may be misidentifications of common stuff.

In truth, I'm totally willing to concede there's absolutely no way anything other than 'ordinary explanations' can account for Nessie et al. Coincidentally, curiously, whateverly, Correa Neto's photos are an example of why. As BSM says, those pics are no worse than anything offered up so far, from ANYWHERE for ANYTHING. And of course we'll never get more confirmation, clearer pictures or even body parts of any one of these 'things' because...there's nothing there to be had. In my post above I was trying more to attribute plausibility than any kind of cosmic truth. Certain things just are what they are i.e. there is no Bigfoot, there is no Loch Ness Monster and there is no funny Dane Cook joke. <img src="http://forums.randi.org/images/smilies/tongue.gif"/>

</quote>
Mr. Coleman seems to be forgetting that, no matter how "critical" a date is, evidence overwhelming points to the Loch Ness Monster not existing.

Most recently, there's <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/3096839.stm">the BBC's 2003 investigation</a> using sonar that found no evidence of any large, unidentified animals in the loch. I think Wikipedia sums it up nicely:

<quote>
In 2003, the BBC sponsored a full search of the Loch using 600 separate sonar beams and satellite tracking. The search had enough resolution to pick up a small buoy. No animal of any substantial size was found whatsoever and despite high hopes, the scientists involved in the expedition admitted that this essentially proved the Loch Ness monster was only a myth.

</quote>
What many don't know is that there was a similar search done by Cambridge University in 1962. Here's a snippet of what page 83 of Steuart Campbell's The Loch Ness Monster: The Evidence has to say on the matter:

It was decided to sweep the lake from end to end using a fleet of boats equipped with echo-sounders. This would either force [Nessie] to one end of the lake, where it must finally appear in the shallows, or catch it as it passed through the sonar 'net'. Four boats, so equipped, made six sweeps both by day and by night. It was found that the sonar could be detected at distances greater than 1.5km. Consequently the net must have covered the entire width of Loch Ness."

What happened? Well, Campbell noted that the "net" didn't drive anything before it and that only a single echo was detected during the six sweeps (In other words, 5 sweeps of nothing and 1 with an echo). Said echo occurred just before a, quote, "...pole-like object was spotted in the area". Now, seeing as how no echo was detected after the pole-like object was sighted, as we would expect from a moving animal, this makes me think the object was a rotting log pushed up to the surface by gases created from internal decomposition (as discussed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loch_Ness_Monster#Trees">here</a> ).

Page 84 notes a later incident where two other sonar contacts were detected when the boat engines were turned off. Campbell notes (with a citation) that it has been suggested that the contacts were actually groups of salmon and that, six years later, the expedition's leader claimed that nothing was detected by said expedition. The salmon explanation does have merit, seeing as how large schools of salmon might scatter upon hearing the engine of a boat (and be too small separately to turn up anything significant on sonar), whereas they would most likely regroup after the noise that scared them went away. If we are to think that the contacts were Nessies, then why weren't the detected before? A stationary "Nessie" would certainly be large enough to have been detected by the net.

I should also note a 1958 echo-sounder expedition by the BBC that turned up nothing on the live TV broadcast. This is discussed on page 82, where it is also noted that there was a report of something being detected an hour before the broadcast. This begs the question, why wasn't anything detected during the broadcast if there truly are a population of large unknown animals in Loch Ness?

I would expect proponents to demand that I explain the times sonar contacts were made on other expeditions. The following can generate sonar contacts: schools of fish, otters, seals, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loch_Ness_Monster#Discovery_Loch_Ness_.281993.29">seiches</a>. Dick Raynor has much to say about seals in Loch Ness at his site, and <a href="http://www.lochnessinvestigation.com/Seals.html">here</a> is one of his several pages on the matter. Furthermore, Campbell notes the various problems with the scans that supposedly detected Nessie(s) in his book (75-97, 113-114).

Some might argue that Nessie would hide in caves or exit the loch (either by going on land or going out to sea). However, page 87 notes that the supposed ridges or caves reported by the Academy of Applied Science in 1970 were most likely the result of how sidescan sonar can fail to produce an echo when directed at a sloping surface (such as the bottom of the Loch). This was noted by Dr. Roy P. Mackal and campbell notes on the same page that later expeditions failed to find any sign of caves or ridges.

As for going on land, the most likely explanation to be given by proponents is that the scans occurred (or drove out) when the breeding population had left the water for land. The problem with this is that we're expected to believe that a large group of equally large creatures would be able to go on land without being seen or without leaving any evidence of having been there. Seeing as how such things should have been visible to expeditions like the one in 1962 (which went up and down the loch multiple times), this explanation is highly unlikely.

What about secret underwater tunnels that lead to the sea? Well, as page 17 notes, Loch Ness is 16 meters above sea level and "any tunnel large enough to take [Nessie] would drain the lake down to sea level." This page (and page 87) note that glaciers smoothed out the lake during its creation, making the likelihood of tunnels unlikely.

The last refuge of proponents seeking to give Nessie (at least, a biological, non-paranormal Nessie) an "out" for the negative sonar scans, assuming they don't plug their ears and go on about the scans that did yield something, is that the population of Nessies traveled to the sea through one of the two ways the Loch is connected to the sea.

Page 132 of William Knowlton's Sea Monsters discusses these two connections. First is the River Ness, which is known for its shallow waters and the large fishing nets that, quote, "...stretch from bank to bank at two places, but each has a gap through which fish can pass." Presumably the gaps are their to prevent catching all of the fish and negatively effecting the Loch's ecosystem. In any case, it is highly unlikely that large group of creatures of Nessis' reported size would be able to get through that undetected.

The only other connection from the loch to the sea is the Caledonian Canal. but, as Knowlton points out, "In order for a sea monster to enter the loch by the way of the canal, it would have to perform the unlikely feat os passing undiscovered through the ship-lifting locks of the canal." In sort, there is no good escape route for which Nessie and its kin could pass through undetected if they existed. Whether you think Nessie is a plesiosaur, mammal, amphibian, or giant invertebrate (all of which are real theories, BTW), all these explanations can't face up to the facts pointing towards the extremely unlikelihood of any undiscovered large animals existing in Loch Ness.

I should note that I posted much of this information as a comment on Cryptomundo ages ago. Oh, and this recent comment by Coleman makes his swiping DoctorAtlantis' "Bigfoot reading porn" gag image and reposting it on Cryptomundo (minus the DoctorAtlantis watermark) quite humorous.

Wow, that sounds an awful lot like a description of a typical Cryptomundo entry. Besides, implying about the existence of errors without ever noting them is classic Colemonster behavior. Remember that bit about how all skeptical explanations for the Myakka ape had fallen to the wayside (or something to that effect)?

But, that said, MonsterTalk has made some mistakes, such as the use of the
"many have stepped forward claiming to have played Patty" claim. It probably would've been better to say that several cryptoenthusiasts support the idea of living plesiosaurs as well.

<quote>
Most American cryptozoologists, from the beginning, and, indeed, most critical thinking cryptozoologists today reject The Plesiosaur Hypothesis.

</quote>
Notice the focus on American cryptozoologists. If wonder if this means that there were enough cryptozoologists from other countries that promoted the plesiosaur explanation enough to make Coleman back off saying "most cryptozoologists" rejected that explanation.

Furthermore, knowing how elastic crytozoology can be (such as how biologists finding a new species somehow becomes a "victory" for cryptozoology), I would like to see a comprehensive list of cryptozoologists in order to evaluate his claim.

Oh, and here's a bunch of stuff I dug up for the original, much longer version of this post I had planned (but eventually abandoned due to time constraints):

Pages 300-301, 311, 313-318, and 321-323 of The Mammoth Encyclopedia of the Unsolved By Colin and Damon Wilson are all of interest, but I'm only linking to page <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=Mf7ujOGDzZ8C&amp;lpg=PA322&amp;ots=eCYs_J1LHj&amp;dq=dinsdale%20loch%20ness%20supernatural&amp;pg=PA321#v=onepage&amp;q=dinsdale%20loch%20ness%20supernatural&amp;f=false">321</a>. I found this while trying to verify if the rumors I had heard about Tim Dinsdale secretly supporting the paranormal explanation for Nessie were true. The involvement of Beckjord does cast doubt on the matter and I suspect that the rumors might be based on people mixing up details over a letter sent to Dinsdale by one Tim Holiday.

Speaking of Dinsdale, here's page <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=5Yo9AAAAIAAJ&amp;lpg=PA157&amp;dq=dinsdale%20loch%20ness%20plesiosaur&amp;pg=PA157#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false">157</a> from his book, Loch Ness Monster.

Hosts Blake Smith, Ben Radford, and Dr. Karen Stollznow explore the plausibility of alien-human hybridizations, dig into the real science of genetics ? and consider the ethical questions involved.
Weighing in on these issues is Dr. Steven Jones ? noted geneticist, teacher, and television presenter. (He is also the author of many books including Darwin?s Ghost, Introducing Genetics, and Coral: A Pessimist in Paradise.)

Did Stalin really want to build an army of gorilla-human hybrids? Is the upright-walking chimp called Oliver really some kind of chimpanzee-human mix? No - but the plausibility of such creatures may surprise you?

The chupacabra episode was full of excellent information. I haven't heard all those interesting aspects of the story discussed in one place before. I'm all excited about Ben's new book. We will have to have a book discussion thread somewhere when that comes out.

Another thing I noticed is that, being the same age at both Blake and Ben, I get their (sometimes ridiculous) cultural references (to music, or old video games, books, shows, etc.). <img src="http://forums.randi.org/images/smilies/biggrin.gif"/> That makes me happy because I don't always understand old guys babbling about Heuvelmans and Sanderson.

One comment about the Coleman stuff above. Loren can act elitist as if the few True cryptozoologists only know what they are talking about and the other poseurs and scientists do not. That's annoying. But his reference to "cryptozoologists no longer see the plesiosaurus theory as plausible" was not the point. The point was that the media and public at large still do. Nearly every stinking story about Nessie sitings contains the word plesiosaur in reference to its description. And they typically call it a dinosaur. Mmmkay, I'm done complaining.

January 13th: Fee-Fi-Fo-Fum!
Giants appear in cultures around the world: Biblical tales of giants more than ten feet tall; Roman and Greek stories of titans and heroes; European stories of giants of mountain and hill. They all have one thing in common: enormous monsters.

On this episode of MonsterTalk we chat with archeologist Dr. Ken Feder about giants, biblical archeology — and one of the biggest hoaxes in American history.

Frauds, Myths &amp; Mysteries - the book by Ken Feder</a>

The bible has stories of races of giants (but also people who lived to be several hundred years old!); Is there any reason to think that people who lived in ancient times were any larger than modern man?
Are humans generally growing shorter or taller over milliennia?
Why do ancient cultures postulate giants?
What evidence would we expect to see if such creatures existed?
From a physiological point of view, what are the advantages and detriments to gigantism?
Gigantism often is implicit in the term “monster,” — almost all monsters are large (Bigfoot, Nessie, etc.) — you don’t really hear about many “monsters” that are only a few feet tall; what do you see as the link between gigantism and monsters?
One of the most famous hoaxes in American history is The Cardiff Giant. Can you give us an overview of that?
Were most scientists fooled by the giant?
Why were so many people treating the Biblical giant-tales as literal truth?
Are there other examples where people have misinterpreted archeological data to infer that it implied Giants?
Does giant architecture imply giant builders?

FIRST IMPRESSIONS

This week on MonsterTalk we talk with fingerprint expert and self-described Bigfoot research ?cheerleader? Jimmy Chilcutt. Chilcutt, a retired Texas lawman and crime-scene investigator, came to prominence in the Bigfoot community when he joined Dr. Jeff Meldrum in the documentary Sasquatch: Legend Meets Science making the pronouncement that his research had found evidence that some Bigfoot track-castings showed signs of dermal ridges ? the equivalent of primate fingerprints. This is the first time we have interviewed someone on the ?believer? side of the fence in cryptozoology, though you?ll hear in the interview that what Chilcutt is willing to attest to is somewhat different than the impression you?d get from his TV appearances.

Topics in this episode include: How did Chilcutt get involved with Bigfoot? Did he identify any hoaxed tracks in the casts he examined? What are ?dermal ridges?? Has he examined any latent Bigfoot prints? How many casts showed the ridges? Has anyone replicated his findings? We also discuss Matt Crowley?s research which shows that it is possible to mimic dermal ridges during the casting process. Crowley?s excellent research is detailed on his website in a series of essays and articles. His work on casting artifacts and the track hoaxing of Ray Wallace should be required reading for Bigfoot researchers.

Jimmy acknowledges Crowley but is denying that a number of important casts show artifacts as opposed to genuine dermals. The Bigfooters are going to light up cigars tonight.

Chilcutt seems to have taken the lamest possible path in coming up with a rebuttal to the overwhelming evidence that suggests that the textures on CA-19 are desiccation ridges: He simply ignores the contrary evidence.

Do they have Internet down there in Conroe?

Typical Bigfoot trivia: I was told by Meldrum that the "CA" designations on several of the casts were put there by Grover Krantz, who died in 2002. Chilcutt examined Meldrum's collection in the late 1990's. Perhaps Medrum didn't receive CA-19 until after Krantz' death.

But if that is the case, then what cast did Chilcutt examine?

Since Chilcutt has decided not to concede that he's wrong, we can expect that some within Bigfootery will maintain the textures on CA-19 are "dermal ridges" UNTIL THE END OF TIME.

I want to see someone demonstrate that details as fine as sweat pores can be recorded in plaster. None of the test casts I've made recorded detail as fine as a sweat pore.

It should be noted that at this point there is no original Elkins Creek cast to examine. The original was sent to Meldrum for analysis. He made a copy of the cast and it was destroyed in shipping back to James Akin. The cast Chilcutt examined would have had to have been Meldrum's copy (or a subsequent generation of that copy).

</quote>
I don't know that Chilcutt could answer that question. The chain of custody and generational copy record seems sparse at best. In older casts there is no way to even know if the detail you're examining was present in the original cast given that the pre-latex method of replicating casts often involved pressing the original down into sand and pouring a plaster copy in the subsequent print.

Ohz Nohz!

But seriously, I came away from the interview with the impression (pardon) that Chilcutt believes that the most plausible explanation for what he sees on those three casts is that it is a biological creature. Even though one of the casts is a Freeman cast with a human thumb print on it? And even thought Matt Crowley's shown that casting artifacts can cause similar effects? And even though if it were human footprints we'd expect to see multiple instances across a trackway.

Chilcutt seems earnest, and knowledgeable. But I don't know if he's got much interest in following up on alternative theories at this point. And even if further evidence of alternative explanations come up, they'll have to be sent to him. He's not out looking for them AFAIK.

But as our first "believer" I thought he was a very good interview, and very amicable.

It's unfortunate that Chilcutt has no knowledge whatsoever of the work Matt Crowley has done since their meeting in Jefferson in 2005. Many of the objections that he raised in this interview have been addressed since that time. Large foot shaped impressions have been cast, the pattern follows the contour of the foot and if there is a ball of the foot it follows it and has the sharp bend in flow that Chilcutt stated he had a problem with test casts not having. The flow pattern is on the sides of the foot, the same as in the squatch dermal pattern but not other primates. The ridges are most pronounced in these areas, not all over like Chilcutt claims. Matt has also done tests with other substrates and have had similar results as well. Chilcutt also seems not to have any knowledge that CA-19 was part of a sequence of casts from the same trackway that also obviously exhibit casting artifacts.

If he would actually see these test casts he would probably have a different view. CA-19 exhibits the pattern that he bases all other casts said to have dermals on. The Freeman casts were cast in Loess soil ( also shown by Lon Erickson to produce artifacts ) as well as in the Blue Mountains that also have high amounts of volcanic ash. The scar that he finds to be authentic closely resembles a test cast that was produced by mud suction. The Elkins Creek cast that Chilcutt says has the pattern on the sides of the foot actually appears to have a geometric grid pattern that resembles burlap, which is used to reinforce plaster. In the Skookum cast what is claimed to be dermals on the heel actually runs contrary to the pattern Chilcutt claims squatch's have.

I think Chilcutt attends the same school of thought as Meldrum. Even after they come to the realization 'there is no Bigfoot', what's it matter really to their future and/or their 'reputations' to just continue a charade of its existence if the actual chances of Bigfoot being somehow-but-genuinely disproved are nil to none. Not sure why they think simply 'coming clean' wouldn't be a better idea, but...

Their 'staying the course' helps them avoid having to answer the harder questions. I mean, how could these held-in-such-high-esteem 'experts' be so oblivious to and/or unwilling to see the 'glaring problems' so many other non-experts so easily see? I'm definitely through publicly lamenting Meldrum's pro-Bigfoot/science dilemma - the answer was always right there, as dishonest and corrupt as it is.

Um. The substrate where the print was made would have had to preserve the feature before the plaster could pick it up. You could try casting your own foot directly in plaster. If that doesn't work, then it would not pick it up EVER in a print.

Wet sand along a creekbed is generally rather large-grains - too large to preserve even dermal ridges. You need some medium-fine to fine grained sediment to preserve such small features. Am I correct?

I guess the main question I had throughout the episode, and I'm not sure I want to spend the time to look up the answer, is how variable is the process of casting? Is the material the same? What can you do differently each time? What other substances can be used in the process.? It would seem to me that these casting artifact questions have decent test cases somewhere.

That's partially my point. If the substrate can't record the detail then what is being observed is not a pore. The same goes for the plaster. Even if the substrate could record the detail if the plaster can't record it then again the detail is not a pore but some type of artifact.

You don't need to prove or disprove the details are pores if you can demonstrate that the detail is too fine to be recorded in the first place. To date the finest detail I've been able to record in plaster (and the substrate) are my own dermal ridges, but those have been under ideal conditions.

<post author="tube" datetime="2010-02-04T19:50:00" id="p176">
My own tests are in agreement with Bitter Monk's. I posted the results elsewhere on the Internet, but never got around to putting up a page on my own site.

Basically I learned from Chilcutt himself that Silly Putty is an ideal substrate in the sense that it can capture detail as fine as human sweat pores. I washed my hands thoroughly in hot water and Dr. Bronner's soap. Using a 14X loupe, I could easily see the sweat pores on the ridge peaks of my thumb dermals. Pressing my thumb into a blob of virgin Silly Putty I made a deep indentation.

***NOTE: "VIRGIN" IN THIS SENSE MEANS NOT PREVIOUSLY USED***

Using the loupe again, I could see that the Silly Putty captured that level of detail, i.e. I could see the little bumps in the valleys created by the ridges. Casting with thin Ultracal 30 most certainly captured the ridges, but NOT the sweat pores.

Chilcutt also spoke at length about the "scar" on what he called the "Walla Walla" cast, which I understand has also been called "Wrinkle Foot." I've included a short treatment of that issue here:

<a href="http://orgoneresearch.com/2009/10/19/dermal-ridges-and-scars/">http://orgoneresearch.com/2009/10/19...ges-and-scars/</a>

As an aside, I find it interesting that Chilcutt mentioned that he's been sent various artifacts like jam jars that contain latent prints. Interestingly, they all turned out to be human.

<post author="idoubtit" datetime="2010-02-05T15:12:00" id="p177">
I dug out Lockley's Tracking Dinosaurs and he notes that skin impressions are only made 1) the substrate is fine mud, such as the consistency of potters clay and 2) when there is little movement of the foot when the track is being placed due to smearing.

I'm discarding the sweat pores idea because silly putty type sediment wouldn't exist in the American NW. You might get that if Patty walked in lagoons like the kind that preserves bird feathers or melanosomes.

What I might suggest to footprint collectors is to take a sample of the substrate in the same location as the track. Then, you can test the substrate with human tracks to see if one is able to reproduce dermal ridges. But, that would be scientific and far more careful than what has been done in the past.

<post author="Bitter Monk" datetime="2010-02-05T18:18:00" id="p178">
It's not as simple as just taking a soil sample from the same location. Moisture content of the soil, humidity, and temperature (ambient, soil, and slurry temp) can all affect the casting process.

I'm talking about looking at grain size and attempting to replicate preservation of a print with that material. The grain sizes will either be small enough to preserve such features or not.

Were I taking a fossil sample, I would record many more pieces of orientation data prior to removal. But since I can't take a fresh track way, I would take a sample of the substrate.

<post author="Bitter Monk" datetime="2010-02-06T07:01:00" id="p180">
Oh I'm not disagreeing with you. Just like you noted with orientation data there is much that needs to be recorded other than just the process of pouring a bunch of slurry into a hole in the ground.

Author Greg Long discusses his book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1591021391?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=skepticcom-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1591021391">The Making of Bigfoot</a> which chronicles his search to get to the bottom of the Patterson-Gimlin film. His findings destroy the image of Roger Patterson as a simple country man looking for Bigfoot at the right place and right time. And it provides at least one plausible answer to the question ?What did Patterson film that day in 1967?? Or should we say ?Who??

Long presents a very plausible tale of how two cowboys came to film one of the most controversial pieces of footage in American history.

Special Note to JREF Bigfoot Forum Folks:
We tried to address some of the pressing questions about Long's book in this episode. Here's some of the stuff we tried to nail down:
Why was the timeline of the film's development important, and why would Patterson lie about it?
Why don't we have the original film that Patterson shot?
Who has the original?
Why is that important?
Did Patterson ever make any money with the film?
Does Bob H have any evidence to back up his claims to be the man in the suit?
Why is the Bob H's description of the suit up close different from that of Philip Morris?
What about others who have claimed to be in the suit?
================================================
Hopefully you'll find Long's talk informative. His book is very interesting and has a lot of details in it. After reading it I didn't find it to be the sort of "Patterson Hit Piece" some have described, but I don't think I'd want to loan Patterson any money if I knew all the details Long described. Even so, I can't help but think that it would've been interesting to meet him. He sounded like quite a character.

This week on Monstertalk, we begin a multi-episode examination of ghosts. We start at the core of the idea by discussing the plausibility of continued consciousness after death. Our guest is neurologist and skeptical activist, Dr. Steven Novella. Steven is a prolific blogger whose work regularly appears on SkepticBlog.org, NeurologicaBlog, Science Based Medicine and The Rogues Gallery. He is the president of the New England Skeptical Society, and host of the popular Skeptic’s Guide To the Universe podcast as well as the short-form SGU 5x5.

All three hosts of MonsterTalk have conducted ghost investigations. Ghosts are a huge topic, and it will take many episodes to cover this type of phenomena. We begin with a brief discussion of the nomenclature, and some of the strange implications of ghosts in relation to privacy. We will dig much deeper into these issues in future episodes, bringing our own unique experiences to bear on the topics.

In this episode

The terminology of ghost hunting
New England and the culture of “Ghost Country”
The legacy of Ed and Lorraine Warren
The distinction between demons and ghosts
and the impact of religion on ghost belief
The mind as hardware/software
The brain as an antennae for consciousness
Connections between NDE and ghost sightings
The NESS’s own ghost investigations
Many tangential topics including AI, robots and Dungeons &amp; Dragons

What happens when a creature thought to be extinct is spotted alive in the swamps of Arkansas? Can such a creature have survived? Can scientists verify the story? And when a town?s hopes and a school?s grant money are on the line, to what lengths will people go to find proof?

This week on MonsterTalk we discuss these issues with Scott Crocker, the documentary filmmaker behind <a href="http://www.ghostbirdmovie.com">Ghost Bird</a> ? a feature length exploration into the mystery of the Ivory-billed woodpecker.

Producer's Note: The audio during the show is rough during the host-chat before the interview. It clears up a good bit after about 5 mins. Apologies for this. We are seeking an alternative recording program and will be working to improve our sound.

Ghost investigations often feature in television shows and other media. Typically, these amount to people wandering around at night with EMF detectors, talking into the darkness and jumping at shadows and noises.

But how does one do a scientific paranormal investigation? On this first half of a two-part MonsterTalk, the hosts review two past ghost investigations (Ben Radford?s ?Kimo Theater Ghost? and Dr. Karen Stollznow?s ?Waverly Hills Sanatorium? investigations) and discuss some of the techniques that can help solve such cases. What steps are common to this type of research? Learn more this week on MonsterTalk.

HISTORICAL GHOST INVESTIGATIONS
PART II ? SINKING THE WATERTOWN

<img src="http://www.skeptic.com/eskeptic/10-04-21images/SSWatertown-ghosts-243.jpg"/>

This week, MonsterTalk continues its two-part discussion of historical ghost investigations. Blake Smith describes his investigation into a famous photo that allegedly shows two dead sailors floating off the side of a 1920?s oil tanker. Methodology for conducting historical investigation is detailed, using Ben Radford?s upcoming book on scientific paranormal investigation as a basis for the talk.

Did two sailors haunt their fellow shipmates? Does the photo really show two ghosts? Find out the answers in this informative conclusion ? and find out how you can solve your own cases!

In this episode

Blake Smith?s Watertown research is in the April (UK) and May (US) editions of <a href="http://www.forteantimes.com">Fortean Times</a>.

Much of the material for these Episode 15 &amp; 16 of MonsterTalk come from Ben Radford?s upcoming book on <a href="http://www.radfordbooks.com">Scientific Paranormal Investigation</a>.

The following is a brief sample of Ben?s insights which come from his own experiences in this field:

General Versus Specific Claims

As an investigator, you will be dealing with specific cases and claims. For example, general claims might be that house X is haunted, or person Y is psychic. Specific claims would be that a ghost was reported or photographed on one or more specific occasions at house X, or psychic Y can read volunteer?s minds. General claims are not testable or falsifiable (you cannot prove or disprove the existence of Bigfoot or psychic powers, but you can prove or disprove specific claimed examples or reports). One of the most important things is to ask the right questions; you must be able to focus on the relevant issues and know what to look for.

In many cases what seems like one simple question must actually be broken down into several different ones for independent analysis. For example, say a published report by a writer (Person A) quotes a psychic, ghost investigator, or eyewitness (Person B) as describing a ghost experience (information X).

To begin investigating, we first need to examine all the components of the claim: 1) Did Person B actually give Information X? Who heard him/her say that? Is there any independent proof or written record of it, or is it just A?s assertion? What, exactly, was the information? It could be that the claim is wrong; she said something different, and the story got better in the retelling. 2) Is the Information X accurate or plausible? For example, are they describing something that they physically could not have seen from their alleged location?

In sum, you need to not only verify that the claim about person A?s information is accurate (that is, she really said what it was claimed she said), but also that the information itself is accurate (information X correctly matches independently gathered information about Person B). Do not assume anything; check out everything.

Once you have chosen a mystery to investigate, you should research the topic thoroughly, on three levels: A) the general topic; B) the localized version of the topic; and C) the specific sighting, event, or phenomenon.

For example, if you are looking into a Bigfoot sighting on a farm in rural Pennsylvania, you need to not only learn as much as you can about that specific incident (C), but you also should research the history of Bigfoot sightings in Pennsylvania (B), as well as have a general knowledge (A) of Bigfoot sightings, claims, hoaxes, etc.

If you are investigating a local missing persons case where a psychic detective claims to have solved the crime, you should find out all you can about that missing persons case (C), but also do some investigation into the psychic detective herself (B), as well as have a good understanding of the skeptical literature about psychics detectives (A), their history, claims, and methods.

Types of mysteries and investigations

There are basic types of investigations you?ll encounter as a paranormal investigator. These divisions are not hard and fast, and some investigations fall into more than one category, but each of them requires a slightly different focus.

Historical mysteries

Historical cases are those in which an unexplained event or phenomena happened at some time in the past, usually at a specific place, and is not currently active. This might include the Great Pyramid of Ghiza, the Amityville Horror case, the Nasca lines of Peru, the Bermuda Triangle, the 1947 Roswell Crash site, and so on. My investigation of the Pokémon Panic (Chapter 11) is a historical mystery, as were parts of my chupacabra investigation (Chapter 14). These cases are often solved largely through careful research and analysis. While I always advocate actually going to the place where the mystery occurred, it is not always practical or useful in historical mysteries. For example it?s unlikely you will uncover any new information by visiting the Great Pyramid, or taking a cruise through the Bermuda Triangle.

Forensic research mysteries

Forensic research mysteries are similar to historical mysteries, though not necessarily tied to a specific place. Such investigations might include investigating a psychic detective?s claim of having solved an old crime, or looking at Nostradamus?s prophecies, or re-examining a person?s claim of alien abduction. ?The psychic and the serial killer case? case is an example of a forensic research mystery. Like historical mysteries, these cases are often solved by attention to detailed research and analysis?discovering a ?smoking gun? hidden in some obscure newspaper report, or double-checking facts to find that primary sources contradict the ?official version.? These cases can be especially challenging because the investigator must rely on his or her research skills, and unlike historical mysteries, there may be no actual ?place? to visit to further investigate or do original research: it?s all in books, files, newspaper reports, original documents, and so on. However, all investigations?every single one, no matter the subject matter?begins with good background research, and sometimes the mystery is solved by doing little more than reading what you found.

Typical Bigfoot trivia: I was told by Meldrum that the "CA" designations on several of the casts were put there by Grover Krantz, who died in 2002. Chilcutt examined Meldrum's collection in the late 1990's. Perhaps Medrum didn't receive CA-19 until after Krantz' death.

But if that is the case, then what cast did Chilcutt examine?

Since Chilcutt has decided not to concede that he's wrong, we can expect that some within Bigfootery will maintain the textures on CA-19 are "dermal ridges" UNTIL THE END OF TIME.

</quote>
According to Meldrum's book, he had worked with Krantz since 1996, and Krantz "passed the baton" in 2001, when "most of his cast collection was transferred." Meldrum says he himself already had collected some casts by that time. Sasquatch: Legend Meets Science, p. 22.

Joe Nickell provided me with a better quality version of the photo via Readers Digest Mysteries of the Unexplained. That version has clear signs of tampering - the ghost photo is literally a product of airbrushing and cut &amp; paste 1920's style. But that wasn't evident in the half-tone reproductions from the version that appeared in FATE magazine.

The write-up in Fortean Times has those details but in June (or around that time) I'll put a much longer version of my research up on the web. I feel like I need to wait until after FT is off the shelves so I don't diminish the value of the article I wrote for them. But the full version will include a lot of stuff that wouldn't fit in the 3000 word version.

And that even partials could be verified by comparing to different sections of the genome for confirmation.

The big thing that the show dispelled was the thing that has been chucked around by footers where they said Nelson's findings seemed to indicate Bigfoot when they showed nothing other than completely modern human. The point where you guys replayed Nelson boldly announcing that he now thinks he may have sasquatch DNA just had me shaking my head. Disotell stressed that were talking about variation on the level of Doctor Atlantis and kitakaze, not on the order of genera.

</quote>
Even Nelson has now admitted that the DNA was "probably human." I emailed the guy who owns the cabins in Canada, he said that the scientists never got back to him on the results. So I told him he didn't have to worry about Bigfoot. The single nucleotide polymorphism, that Nelson focused on as being unlikely to be human ("5,000 to 1 odds"), is actually frequently found in Native Americans in Canada, and of course there is a NA village only a few miles away, with a road leading to the lake where the cabin is. Of course, Dr. Meldrum and MonsterQuest won't tell you that. From what I could gather from his emails, Nelson, who is an entomologist and is not a Ph.D, seems to have been completely out of his league in trying to interpret the DNA of a human (or pretty much anything else, it seems to me). He denies he made the 5,000 to 1 statement. I assume the only reason he got involved was his pre-existing belief in Sasquatch (He was a member of one of the Bigfoot "research organizations.")

Geneticists I contacted scoffed at Nelson's findings and indicated that the identification of human DNA is trivial.

In this week?s episode, MonsterTalk looks once again at genetics and creatures created in the laboratory. Dr. Marcus C. Davis joins the hosts to discuss what constitutes a ?monster.? In his work, Davis deals with paleontology, as well as embryological manipulation ? which, by some definitions, means he literally creates monsters.

Some questions we address with Dr. Marcus:

What defines a monster ? and what is the history
of the word in a scientific context?
What does it mean to create a monster in the lab?
What are the ethical bodies that govern embryological and genetic experiments?
How do scientists feel about being subject to those levels of oversight?

The literary work of Howard Phillips Lovecraft is dark and macabre. It casts a long shadow in American Literature, influencing such writers as Rod Serling, Steven King, Bob Howard, Robert Bloch, and many others. In his stories he wove a tapestry of mad alien gods and unspeakable horrors and the insignificance of man. And of a mountainous evil that sleeps in the ocean, worshipped by mad cults and known only as ? Cthulhu.

<img src="http://www.skeptic.com/podcasts/monstertalk/10/07/21/images/TinaResch-FRAME-25-flying-phone.jpg"/>
Early in March of 1984, the Ohio newspaper The Columbus Dispatch began to tell the tale of a 14 year old girl who was undergoing a terrible ordeal. Objects in her house began to fly across the room and smash. Clocks ran faster than normal. Silverware and china flew and broke. Several witnesses reported seeing these terrifying events and a newspaper man caught photos of a telephone flying through the air in front of the frightened teen.

Tina Resch, a foster child, was in the care of a couple who, over the course of 31 years would take care of over 250 foster children. Was she just seeking attention? Or was she being plagued by the terrifying paranormal phenomena known as a POLTERGEIST?

We talk with James “The Amazing” Randi on his recollections of this case and on the tragic life of a poltergeist victim. Randi highlights the case in his upcoming book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0035JICUI?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=skepticcom-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0035JICUI">A Magician in the Laboratory</a> (digital excerpt).

DARREN NAISH is a palaeozoologist, freelance author and science writer of the Tetrapod Zoology column on ScienceBlogs. Affiliated with the university of Portsmouth, he obtained a degree in geology and then gained a PhD in vertebrate palaeontology at this institution. He mostly works on Cretaceous dinosaurs and pterosaurs, and “also messes around with swimming giraffes, fossil marine reptiles, British big cats and stuff like that.”

<img src="http://www.skeptic.com/eskeptic/10-08-11images/naish.jpg"/>

Darren joined us on MonsterTalk to talk about the intersection of mainstream science and cryptozoology. Topics include: How did a credentialed scientist become involved in cryptozoology? The relationship between cryptozoology and ethnobiology A discussion of “Caddy” The most plausible cryptids in Darren’s POV? Old photos, rotting creatures, alien big cats, hominids, creatures of the deepest sea — and much, much more… This is part 1 of a 2 part discussion of the relationship of science and cryptozoology.

It’s okay to scratch — but don’t skip this episode! Once you get past the disgust factor, there is some amazing science going in parasitology. Our guide into this fascinating world is acarologist Dr. Barry O’Connor, of the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology and the Museum of Zoology, University of Michigan.

Topics include:

What is acarology?
The origin of mange &amp; scabies
The difference between the two diseases
Why does mange cause hair loss?
Why does mange cause death?
What is the life cycle of a mite?
What is the evolutionary origin of dust mites?
Why does the media get excited by hairless animals?

IN THE PANTHEON OF AMERICAN MONSTERS, only one truly dominated the newspapers of the 1990s. Checkout lines everywhere were haunted by the bald-headed, wide-mawed visage of Bat Boy.

What was Bat Boy, and where did he come from? The MonsterTalk team interviews cartoonist Tye Bourdony, a former employee of the Weekly World News and creator of the online comic ? <a href="http://thelightersideofscifi.com">The Lighter Side of Sci-Fi</a> ?. Bourdony has had his comics published in Cracked, Sci-Fi and Star Trek magazines. He provides a behind-the-scenes look at the rise and fall of the famous tabloid paper the*World Weekly News*and shares his insights about the paper?s most popular recurring character: Bat Boy.

There's a short clip of Bernard Heuvelmans talking about the Iceman which I hadn't seen before, but it didn't include anything particularly novel. The podcast is a tad long, probably because I forced myself to slow down so as not to overwhelm those unfamiliar with the subject with too much novel information too quickly.

It should be noted that at this point there is no original Elkins Creek cast to examine. The original was sent to Meldrum for analysis. He made a copy of the cast and it was destroyed in shipping back to James Akin. The cast Chilcutt examined would have had to have been Meldrum's copy (or a subsequent generation of that copy).

I need to make a correction. I've learned since making the above statement that Chilcutt did indeed examine the original Elkins Creek Cast. I don't want to derail the thread but you can find the details of the Elkins cast chain of custody on my blog.

Checked out your blog. Ironically, I made the same kind of observations about the snow tracks in my yard. I should have taken measurements like you did, but saw for myself the amazing amount of deformity in the tracks over a few days. Dog tracks turned into big hoof-sized tracks, for example. Very cool.
Of course it's all gone today. Rained away...

Didn't Marlin Perkins and his party make similar observations in the Himalayas? I seem to remember them looking at the tracks of a fox and how melt and wind changed the track from a fox to a yeti track.

No, we tried to stay focused on the Skookum cast for this episode - but Ben did ask him a rather poignant question about whether or not he thought the question of bigfoot would be resolved in his lifetime. Daniel is only the second of what one might call "believer" we've had on the show, Jimmy Chilcutt being the other. Daniel came across as more cautious and reserved than Chilcutt but neither of them were anything like the average bigfoot advocate I've encountered on the Internet.

I listened to the program and thought it was decent. Unfortunately, Perez seriously undersold the importance of the review by Dr. Anton Wroblewski. He described him as a guy who has been around some elk and says the cast is of an elk - but he isn't an elk expert. Perez neglected to mention that Wroblewski (desertyeti on JREF) is a geologist and ichnologist. The latter distinction is the science of animal tracks and traces (generally prehistoric). This gives him special status for reviewing the cast.

The casual listener who doesn't know anything about him might not be impressed and instead think he is just "some dude".

<post author="William Parcher" datetime="2011-03-16T09:57:00" id="p229">
Also, Perez states that Noll wouldn't give Dr. Wroblewski access to the original cast for inspection and analysis. This may not be completely accurate. It seems that Noll offered access with the condition that he could film Wroblewski during his entire examination. That condition was considered unacceptable, and so the exam never happened.

Based on my contact with Anton, he seems a very private guy. This story doesn't sound implausible, but it didn't come up in my conversation with him.

I would recommend anyone interested in knowing more about these details search JREF for pertinent posts by him. I did get his permission to reprint his elk-lay comparison to the cast and it seems, as I remarked during the show, rather compelling evidence.

I was disappointed Dr. Meldrum didn't get back with me - but maybe he will. He could be on break, or teaching, or doing a documentary, or any number of things.

<post author="tube" datetime="2011-03-16T16:46:00" id="p231">
I don't know if the original files of Bigfoot Forums were ever restored or not. Deep within the original files, Noll uploaded a photograph of a polymeric intermediate cast being made of the original Hydrocal B-11 cast. If I remember correctly, Noll removed all his uploaded photographs from that site, and even if the original thread was restored, the photograph may be missing. From that polymeric intermediate two casts were made, a male and a female duplicate of the original.

These final duplicates were fiber-reinforced plastic, and thus presented much less burden and risk as far as transportation and presentation than the original.

Lost in the wash of words surrounding Anton's analysis was WHY the copies were made in the first place, and by whom. Chris Murphy personally told me that John Green felt that the Patterson film did not properly sway scientists when it came out. Green felt that the Skookum cast might be able to do so instead. Thus it was Green who paid the allegedly high costs for duplication of the original. According to Murphy, Green wanted the cast copies transported around to universities for analysis by scientists. The sad irony for Green is that he got his wish, though obviously not the conclusion he wanted.

Being that Perez is most certainly a Bigfoot advocate, it's not surprising that he has little or no knowledge of the analysis within the professional ichnology community. Perez doesn't need an "elk guy" to perform a proper analysis, it's already been done. Buried within the original Bigfoot Forums thread was the analysis of of Mark Elbroch, considered one of the WORLD'S finest ichnologists:

<a href="http://wildlifetrackers.com/markelbroch/">http://wildlifetrackers.com/markelbroch/</a>

Not surprisingly, Elbroch came to the same conclusion as did Wroblewski, namely that it's an impression of a large cervid.

Clearly there are a variety of reasons why Meldrum may have refused to respond to MonsterTalk's request for comment; another might be that Meldrum's analysis is the laughing stock of professional ichnologists.

While Chilcutt may or may not have examined the original cast, he most certainly examined high quality 3D reproductions. I personally witnessed one in Chilcutt's possession in Texas. While Chilcutt's position on the subject may have changed over time, he most certainly put "dermal ridges" on the cast.

Perhaps because Perez is a Bigfoot advocate, he chooses to take the analysis of Henner Fahrenbach as his smoking gun.

This is one of the fundamental problems with the whole Bigfoot field; namely that they form a cult-like clique, and often fail to obtain professional analysis from those whose opinions have real world weight. Not surprisingly, those professionals are usually OUTSIDE the Bigfoot clique.

The Skookum Elk Cast got as far as it did because Meldrum, et al, failed to consult professional ichnologists in the first place.

Anton forwarded Elbroch photographs of the cast copies, and Elbroch's rather terse answer was something to the effect that it probably wasn't a small animal like a goat, but rather a cervid.

I'm sure contacting Elbroch directly is the way to go.

Perhaps someone who follows Bigfoot Forums can advise whether the original files were ever restored to the present forum.

I think "Lil Mak" was a monniker given to the sock puppet that he used most frequently on the Bigfoot threads. RSL should understand that he has had several sockpuppets, and we developed a nickname for this particular sock. Parcher would know the history of that, it is not condescending to the argument, but more of a way to keep his different names in order.

The Zombie Autopsies

This week on MonsterTalk, we interview Harvard medical doctor Steven Schlozman, author of The Zombie Autopsies and get inside the walking dead to discuss a plausible mechanism for the zombie apocalypse. It took a lot of guts, but in this episode we discuss:

* How did a doctor become interested in zombies?
* What can zombies teach us about neurology?
* Which is scarier:infection or cannibalism?
* Why don?t zombies have sex?
* What?s the best way to slice a brain?
* What do brains taste like?

Plus much, much more!

Is cryptozoology science or pseudoscience? Do scientists ever really study cryptozoology, or merely ignore the field entirely? This week we dig into the history of Cryptozoology itself?focusing on the search for America?s most famous cryptid: Sasquatch. This week on MonsterTalk, we?re joined by Dr. Brian Regal to talk about his latest book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0230111475/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=skepticcom-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217153&amp;creative=399701&amp;creativeASIN=0230111475">Searching For Sasquatch: Crackpots, Eggheads and Cryptozoology.</a>

The show was on last night. It was quite entertaining, and they did show some of the video, but it was nothing like the descriptions given earlier. It just looked like wave action to me. I didn't see 15 of anything or anything that would make me think it was unusual.

The large white creature was unrelated to the video as far as I can see. They chased and possibly hooked a large white creature in a lake, but the line broke. It was probably a sturgeon.

The Hillstrands were fun to watch, as usual.

</quote>
I think it's a cetacean. At 0:50 in slow motion there appears to be an exhale (blow) in about the position of a blowhole. It seems small with a smallish puff blow. I'd guess a dolphin/porpoise but it could be one of the small species of toothed whales. An expert should be able to identify it, or narrow to a few species. I think it's just one animal near the surface with some trailing waves.

Yes, the pinnipeds are seals, sea lions, walrus and donkeys.

It could be that but I don't see a snout. Well, it's not a very clear video anyway. I suspect the filmers know what it was.

I agree. The show was highly entertaining.

As an avid angler, I was much more impressed with the sturgeon they hooked up on (now that was a true lake monster) than the stupid video which showed nothing.

I've seen them taking some flack from crypto types because of the firearms and dynamite. But if you ask me, the only way the existence of any crypto is going to ever be confirmed is when it is lying on an examination table being autopsied.

Personally I think they knew exactly what they had hooked into when they hooked the sturgeon. If not, why weren't they throwing the dynamite at the creature right then.

Well, certainly! You need a type specimen to name, describe and publish on a new species. It's incredibly naive and very silly for these cryptozoologists to think some video, photo or even DNA will do it. You need to be able to describe it. Only a body will do. You MIGHT get away with a tooth or another body part but one is asking an awful lot to accept such a creature - the bigger the part, the more credible it will be.

The Big Bad Wolf
<a href="http://traffic.libsyn.com/skeptic/041_Monstertalk.mp3">Play Episode.</a>
Chances are if you listen to MonsterTalk you probably like nature documentaries. No doubt you?ve seen stories about wolves and heard words to the effect that wolves are often maligned and that wolves have an undeserved reputation for being killers. Yet how does one reconcile the idea that dangerous wolves are a myth with the many myths and fairy tales which feature wolves as the villain? In this episode of MonsterTalk we take on the legend of the big, bad wolf and what we find may surprise you. This episode features an interview with author Jay M. Smith, about his book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0674047168/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=skepticcom-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399369&amp;creativeASIN=0674047168">Monsters of the Gévaudan: The Making of a Beast.</a>

FROM THE LOST WORLD to Alley Oop toThe Flintstones, the idea of dinosaurs and humans living together has captured the imagination of readers across the globe. But there are some who believe that this idea isn?t fictional. Is there a population of sauropod dinosaurs living in Africa in modern times?

In this episode of MonsterTalk, we interview paleontologist Dr. Donald Prothero at TAM9 about his research into the creature known as Mokele Mbembe! Cryptozoology, paleontology and creationism converge in the jungles of the Congo.

I enjoyed the interview with Scott Herriott. Scott is an intelligent, articulate, and funny advocate for Bigfootery. His admission that the physical evidence for Bigfoot is weak is admirable, yet his assertion that a history of anecdotal evidence is compelling is flawed.

very nice job. I do think the last shot is an en face view of the bear. And the cub may be what is underneath. But I think it is really putting too fine a point on it, to suggest the cub is nursing. I have never seen a bear nurse while on all fours. Ordinarily the mother bear would be sitting or reclining.

that does look convincing. The eyeshine I've seen in other pics is more convincing than the two dots noted in the en face interpretation. So I have to go with the head on ground version.

The low resolution and grainy images promote pareidolia. River sees an ear, snout, eyes and nostrils on the upside-down head shape. IMO, we may not even be seeing a head there. It could be the rump of another bear (laying?) or something else.

<post author="River" datetime="2012-03-29T09:57:00" id="p280">
Yeah its just a guess at the body position. The head looking back in the link just doesnt work IMHO. Certainly could be another bear, or a large misplaced breast. <img src="http://forums.randi.org/images/smilies/redface.gif"/> Hey, these bigfeet have very unique features!

The head position really doesn't make any difference because the feet are all we need to look at.
The rear foot in the bottom photo is obviously that of a bear.

there is another problem with the en face interpretation: that would require hyperextension of both the left front and left hind leg at the elbow/knee. Bears really don't do that. imho.

Wow - a bigfoot hoaxer with a website using dark background and light writing. What a huge surprise. I have the sound turned off so I don't know if Giraffe is saying he has audio as wretched and offensive as the visuals.

Well, Biscardi says might as well make money both ways - perpetuating the hoax and "exposing" it at the same time. Maybe he is getting commission on Greg Long's book.

Interesting that my first cabin in the woods was actually 35 years ago in Iowa so I went to his Iowa research expedition. I think it is below Blevins quality work. Five bigfoot sightings for him in 32 years living in cities and none for me living 35 years in the woods. I just can't seem to find bigfoot.

If you are a skeptic, it's because you aren't in the woods looking for it. If you go in the woods, and don't find it, it's because you are looking for it. It's kind of like the Uncertainty Principle. I call it the Unsquatchity Principle.

German police report sait it was a ballon.

Cologne - Cologne, this phenomenon is observed more often in the night sky, unexplained lights, bright objects, move silently and quickly over the city. Behind it are UFOs. No joke! It is Unlawful Flight objects.

Also on Friesenplatz they made a stir. Resident George Hemmersbach (92) tells excitedly, "I lay in bed and looked out into the dark night. As they came flying, seven colorful light balls up like pearls on a necklace. As fast as a helicopter, but totally silent. I woke my wife, we went onto the balcony. Then again three floated in the dark and very fast high-pass, and then another three! "

Are these UFOs? This question shot the urkölschen couple - married for 65 years, 44 years in the same apartment - of course through my mind. For not a plausible explanation, they had at hand: "We actually typed on balloons," said his wife, Wilma (85). "But not at night, flying through Cologne!"
Paper balloons, which are driven with a flame.

There is absolutely nothing we can determine about the contents of that video. It's 138 frames, 400x220 pixels, and 4.6 seconds long at ~30fps. Even when I view it by tweaking zoom, sharpness, brightness, contrast, and/or saturation, there's nothing that would separate it from pointing a camera at a stationary light and wiggling the camera, or following a kid who is running across the backyard holding a flashlight.

Hi Aliens. "Why not" isn't always the best question around which to initiate a discussion about a belief. After all, why not believe in fairies and goblins - or Santa Claus for that matter?

Perhaps so, but believing that other life exists in the universe, and believing in aliens (which by definition is life that has traveled here to Earth) are two very different things. So although the vastness of the universe may or may not be a legitimate reason for believing in other forms of life in other places, it also speaks against that life visiting our planet.

You're wrong, "alien" just means that they're from another world, not that they're here. It's the same for the more local definition of "from another country". The term is more commonly used if the alien is in a country foreign to them, but it's not wrong to use it otherwise.

So, for example, I'm British and am currently residing in Britain, therefore it is entirely correct for me to describe Barack Obama as an alien, despite the fact that he is from the US and currently resides in the US.

Explain to me why Bigfoot on a unicorn is any more ridiculous than aliens from outer space. It seems to me that Bigfoot on a unicorn is more likely, being that they wouldn't have to cross the vast distances of space to get here, and therefore less ridiculous than interstellar-traveling aliens.

That's something I think most people don't realize. Interstellar travel is probably the least reasonable idea we've ever used in fiction. The distances are so large they stop making sense. They're actually rated in the time it would take light to move that far, and so far, moving faster than light is impossible.

The farthest we could have transmitted radio is still so close that we might as well not be transmitting at all. Nothing could have found us. Nothing could have come to visit because of our transmissions.

Aliens probably do exist, but the only way they could have come here is by actual magic, not space ships.

Hello and welcome ALIENS!

It's simply not possible to judge what is on the video. It could be anything. Any speculation would just be a wild guess with no evidence to support it.

In this forum are people who are knowledgeable about the history of UFOs in western culture, who are very familiar with famous and not so famous UFO cases over many decades. Some people here have looked into UFO cases in greater depth and more methodically than "professional" UFO researchers. You will find many people who are sincerely interested in UFOs and in identifying them.

What you won't find are many people who accept the "Extra-Terrestrial Hypothesis", that is the idea that UFOs are spacecraft from another planet. The reason that we don't accept this hypothesis is not out of knee jerk prejudice or by simply declaring "I refuse to believe!". The reason is instead that so far there has not been any convincing evidence to support that hypothesis.

I grew a science fiction fan and was a UFO enthusiast since childhood. I have seen UFO's many times. In my teens I read all the UFO accounts I could get my hands on and I believed that the evidence supported the alien spacecraft theory in cases like Roswell or the 1976 Tehran incident. I made my own files from media accounts of UFO sightings. I was open to the idea of alien abduction. I was angry that the media didn't treat the phenomenon more seriously and I thought they were overlooking the evidence. I began to research the subject more seriously, looking for whatever primary sources a teenager could turn up in his public library.

When I did so I began to find that the evidence that seemed so convincing began to melt away. So much of what was reported was hearsay, claims of artifacts and physical evidence turned out to be untrue. I began learning about the fallibilty and unreliability of eyewitnesses on any subject, especially unexpectedly seeing something they don't recognise. I found out how incredibly common misinterpretation of what we see is, even in the most ordinary circumstances. I found out about memory and it's limitations. I learned about the huge numbers of hoaxes, both simple and complicated, that fooled the most dedicated investigators.*

I came to realize that I wanted to believe in aliens. This meant that I was predisposed to trusting what I was told and not examining claims in favour of aliens as suspiciously or as thoroughly as I examined claims of "debunkers". When I realized this I had to decide if I wanted to know the truth about UFOs or if I just wanted reinforce my belief by ignoring evidence that contradicted it.

If you are serious about wanting to know what people have been seeing in your town you will need to keep a truly open mind. That means acknowledging that while it is possible that what has been seen is extra terrestrial the odds are overwhelming that it is of Earth origin. To even seriously consider that it might be extra terrestrial you should have direct evidence that is the case (perhaps physical evidence or even multiple witnesses seeing non-humans in the windows of a spacecraft.) If such evidence exists you (and we) can begin to test it and evaluate it's merits.

If direct evidence of alien origin does not exist it would be unreasonable to consider the Extra-Terrestrial Hypothesis without first eliminating any plausible ways the phenomena might be of Earth origin. And one thing that has been demonstrated in the last 60 odd years of UFO investigation is that there are huge numbers of Earthly explanations that have been proven to be the cause for amazing things people have seen.

A couple of quick anecdotes from my own experience. I have seen an incredible glowing disk fly over the car I was in on a hillside late at night. The driver stopped and got out to look for it. Another one came past - but this time we could tell it was the headlights of cars on the other side of the hill reflecting off low clouds. If we hadn't stopped at that place we would not have been able to tell. The illusion was very convincing.

Another time my flatmate and I were fooled by a glowing ball that flew erratically above the city. We watched through the glass door in our front room. It flew unlike any aircraft I had ever seen. I could not explain it. Eventually we tried to determine how fast it was moving as it swooped, spun and climbed. we tried to estimate it's distance from various landmarks and to guage it's apparent movement between them. As we watched I slowly realized that it wasn't moving at all. Even though I perceived it as jumping around the sky as soon as I compared it's position to fixed landmarks it was always in the same place. I used a marker pen on the glass door over it's position and lined it up with another mark on the coffee table in front of the couch. Sure enough, when I sat on the couch and lined up my crude "sight" the object did not move. We came to the conclusion that it was just a very bright star or planet. The thin clouds scudding across the sky created the illusion of movement and the more we focussed our eyes on an object in the sky with no landmarks around it, the more it seemed to move.

* To skeptics: this is all true dammit, it's not my fault if it sounds like I ripped it off from Demon Haunted World. <img src="http://forums.randi.org/images/smilies/smile.gif"/>

The police said it was. They've presumably looked into the matter, and identified where it was launched and by whom.

Sky lanterns are launched as part of festivals, and by individuals celebrating a significant event (my nephew launched one at his wedding reception). It's a perfectly reasonable explanation of the light. Why are you doubting it?

This act you are putting on - trying to convince us that you are just another credulous UFO nut - might fool the others, but not me!

It's a clever ploy. Create a straw man parody of your activities - with stories of strange lights in the sky, spaceships piloted by little green men, 'paranormal' crop circles, alien abductions and anal probes, cattle mutilations, ancient astronauts and other nonsense - then let us skeptics knock it down. Anyone with half a brain can figure out that these outlandish claims are bunk, but that blinds us to the truth of what's really Out There. <img src="http://forums.randi.org/images/smilies/eek.gif"/>

On the off-chance that your stealth technology fails and somebody sees an actual alien spacecraft, we will then assume that it's just another misidentification/hoax etc. All the while you are brazenly hiding in plain view, pretending to be one of us blowing the whistle on them. Of course you are careful to appear credulous, so that we will be more inclined to reject your 'evidence'. <img src="http://forums.randi.org/images/smilies/frown.gif"/>

But perhaps a bit too credulous. That an otherwise intelligent person would be sucked in by such hogwash is a bit hard to swallow, don't you think? Skeptics may be fooled into thinking that you believe it because they consider themselves intellectually superior, but it's more likely that you are simply lying. The only question is, why the subterfuge? The answer is obvious - to keep us from guessing The Truth. <img src="http://forums.randi.org/images/smilies/wink.gif"/>

Oh yes, I'm onto your little scheme. You and your cohorts Erich Von Daniken, David Icke, Whitley Strieber, Rramjet and all those other infamous 'ufologists'. It's so obvious that you are all lying, yet most of us haven't figured out the reason for your campaign of misdirection - which is to discredit the entire field of ufology so that any real evidence will then be ignored. <img src="http://forums.randi.org/images/smilies/mazeguyemotions/boggled.gif"/>

The object was following the flightpath of aircraft, but no signs of flashing landing lights as per the previous plane images. It was flying at one point above cloud level but below the trails of high level planes, you could tell that from the video.

It would be a simple matter to rule out or in the possibility of it being a balloon or a hot air lantern by checking on the wind direction at the time of the video. The minimum height of the object could be estimated by the height of the low level cloud that night.

Its speed compared to the rooftops below and other reference points which are visible on the video seems steady, unless I missed something, and similar to that of the known aircraft.

The diameter of the light is quite impressive, again compared to its height above the clouds compared to that of the lights from a plane, and if this was a festive hot air lantern at that height, it would surely have been a pinpoint of light and far less bright.

It could have been an airship/blimp, lit internally, which I know some are, and could cause that area of brightness perhaps, at that height.

The whole point of it being unidentified kind of lets us know you didn't know what it was.

You're wrong, "alien" just means that they're from another world, not that they're here. It's the same for the more local definition of "from another country". The term is more commonly used if the alien is in a country foreign to them, but it's not wrong to use it otherwise.

So, for example, I'm British and am currently residing in Britain, therefore it is entirely correct for me to describe Barack Obama as an alien, despite the fact that he is from the US and currently resides in the US.

</quote>
This may be technically true, but from a common usage standpoint I stand by my definition. I think few if any people nowadays (other than perhaps the extremely xenophobic) would refer to the billion-plus citizens quietly residing in China as "aliens" unless and until they travel to another country and reside there for a period. It's like arguing the definition of "UFO." Technically it's just a flying whatnot that hasn't been positively identified yet, and as such can be any old mundane thing. But when someone stands up and pronounces "I believe in UFO's!" I'm pretty sure most people would assume she's talking specifically about extraterrestial spacecraft.

The police said it was. They've presumably looked into the matter, and identified where it was launched and by whom.

The implication, however, is that it's particularly unusual for the helicopters to be there because it's so sparsely populated. Yet, wherever ALIENS is, s/he is close to a large population centre, making his/her reason for listing the number of people where s/he lives irrelevant.

This is the fundamental flaw in thinking among UFO nuts. Somebody saw something in the sky that they didn't understand. Nobody can explain it (usually because there's just not enough information available to explain it). Therefore: Aliens. Most of these people have an overwhelming need to believe in extraterrestrial visitation, so their default explanation for anything without any other obvious explanation is aliens.

While I don't think it's completely outside the realm of the possible that intelligent extraterrestrial beings could visit the earth, absent strong evidence that this has actually happened it's going to be near the bottom of my list of possible explanations for anything seen in the sky. I'm perfectly happy with, "Well, I'm not really sure exactly what that strange light in the sky was".

It's a depressing thought that there may never have been and may never be any visitors to Earth from outer space. As it is highly unlikely, statistically, either that life only exists on Earth or that life on Earth is the most advanced in the Universe, it seems to follow that it is probably very difficult for sentient life to travel through space and get anywhere meaningful, e.g. to another habitable planet.

Maybe we are in a region of space in which there is a very low density of habitable planets (I mean habitable by higher life forms like us, I don't mean bacteria or spores etc). Perhaps there are other regions where habitable planets abound in reasonably close proximity to each other such as to have given rise to highly advanced interplanetary civilisations and wars etc. And perhaps we shall never know, due simply to the sheer vastness of the space that separates us from any planet capable of sustaining higher life forms.

To the opening poster, the arrival here of sentient life would be such a remarkable event that it would require correspondingly clear and remarkable evidence to justify our accepting that it had occurred and your 4 second film does not appear to contain such evidence.

We see a lot of blimps in the air in Central Florida.

I have little doubt that they have generated some UFO reports even here where odd things in the sky aren't that unusual.

They can look very much like a flying saucer, especially when viewed from a distance. Some are illuminated from the inside at night which really makes them look odd. My wife and I drove towards one for about an hour one night, all the way joking about the alien craft we kept watching.

Many years earlier, I saw a strange, flickering light moving back and forth near the horizon at night. Later I learned, through news reports, that it was an advertising plane with lights under the wing that displayed a scrolling message. The plane was flying in circles around some event location (probably a football stadium) and, from a distance, looked odd enough that several people called in UFO reports to the media.

There's a large white tethered blimp just before you get to Key West. It has no visible markings and I suspect it may monitor radio traffic in Cuba or some such. The first time I saw it, it looked for all the world like a hovering disk. Oddly I didn't think it was an alien craft and didn't take a photo of it.

Some herbs have properties like drugs, how come they're never as potent?
</headline>
<post author="Crocoshark" datetime="2012-03-23T12:10:00" id="p1">
According to wikipedia, Echinacea has anti-inflammatory properties, and a recent Cracked article talked about how St. John's Wort has chemicals in it that are good for mild to moderate depression. It cited a paper showing that levels of the chemical in the herbs you buy at the store range from something like 60 to 135% of the level on the label. And some plants and mushrooms will get you totally stoned. Some herbs DO have negative side effects, but it seems like most of them don't.

My question is why are, for example, anti-inflammatory chemicals as herbs lacking on average the potency and adverse effects of anti-inflammatory chemicals as drugs?

Also, why don't plants that get you stoned or have other strong drug effects end up circulating in the herb industry?

The herbs lack the potency because we make the drugs by isolating the active ingredients from the herbs. Then we modify those active ingredients to see if they can be more potent.

Opium is mild.

Morphine is extracted from opium (throwing away all the crud and flowery bits that it's mixed with), and is more potent.

A few hundred derivatives of morphine are made in the lab and tested, and it's found that the diacetyl derivative is much more potent. Heroin is born.

Opium will never have the potency of heroin.

I seem to remember reading somewhere that opium is derived from morphine in a ratio of something like 200:1 to 100:1 (depending on the potency of the individual poppy flowers), and turning that morphine into heroin (diacetylmorphine HCl) results in a substance roughly 3 times as potent. So in the illicit drug trade, the farmers who grow the opium typically process it onsite at the farm, or else transport it to nearby labs for conversion into crude morphine (thus drastically reducing the weight of the exported product), which is then often transported to a more sophisticated lab for further processing into heroin.

Because historically, most drugs have come from natural chemicals (ie, herbs), where the active ingredient is isolated, synthesized and often improved upon. So drugs have higher concentrations of active ingredient and have been altered to be more effective.

For example, willow bark tea was sometimes used as a headache remedy.
Around 1829 scientists identified the pain relief as being caused by a substance they called salicin.
In 1838 the pure form of the substance, called salicylic acid was produced.
In 1853 it was discovered that neutralizing salicylic acid by buffering it with sodium (sodium salicylate) and acetyl chloride made it less damaging to the stomach.

They marketed this substance as Aspirin. A single tablet of Aspirin gives you far more active ingredient and is gentler on the stomach than drinking several cups of willow bark tea, making it a far more effective drug than the natural alternative.

There's a company that does independent testing of supplements and herbal remedies (I can't remember who they are, or find the link at the moment); and they've posted test for some that go as low as 0% of active ingredients, and a few high enough to be getting into toxic levels.

From what I've heard, the high isn't unpleasant; but nutmeg contains a powerful purgative, and the aromatic oils can be pretty overwhelming, since you have to use fresh nutmeg. Everyone I know who has tried it said the taste and vomiting were so bad it put them off eating anything with nutmeg in it, for life.

IIRC, the active component is LSA, a precursor of LSD.
Which is why the seeds you can buy in the shops tend to come impregnated with rather nasty stuff to keep people from using them trip out on. Not a problem if you grow your own.

As others have said, the "active ingredients" in herbs are in a lower percentage than after they're isolated. But as far as the negative side effects, that's because those with significant negative side effects are either abandoned as too liable to cause lawsuits, or made illegal, or both.

A look at herbs used in 19th century medicine will show all kinds of things in common use then that aren't available at the average herbal medicine store today, except as homeopathic preparations where the active ingredients are diluted beyond any possible harm: foxglove, Jimson weed, lobelia, colchicum, henbane, rhubarb root, Mayapple, etc.

Thinking about it, probably because if they did become popular they'd soon be banned, the same way designer recreational drugs initially sold under the legal fiction that they're intended for other things like plant food or bath salts rather than human consumption quickly get banned once they start getting attention from the media.

For natural herbs and plants, we can see the same thing happening. Salvia Divinorium, for example, is a powerful hallucinogen. In the US a number of states have banned it, or are considering banning it, and there have been proposals to make it illegal throughout the entire nation. If it started selling in health-food stores and supermarkets in the states that haven't banned it yet, how long before it's banned completely?

Yep. There are a lot of completely legal deliriants that are easily obtained. Nutmeg in extreme doses, datura/Jimsonweed, belladonna, amanita muscaria, and even high doses of Benadryl and Dramamine. Law enforcement generally doesn't pay any attention to deliriants because they're extremely unpleasant and toxic near the "recreational" dose, and therefore rarely (intentionally) abused. Most people don't find 12 hours of uncontrollable heartbeat and photophobia while having realistic conversations with the spiders pouring out of their dead relatives' orifices to be an enjoyable time.

I'm not sure if you're referring to cannabis, or herbs in general, but you're quite right, nature definitely isn't always better - which is why isolation of the active ingredient is usually better and safer. But there are cases where multiple compounds act synergistically in the natural product or moderate adverse effects, and it's important that these interactions be understood to maximise benefit and minimise adverse effects.

It's fairly true, but not that simple. Up until recently many growers only grew for high THC levels. High THC levels increase the high, but also increase the likelihood of an anxiety reaction, or full-blown panic attack (the "paranoia" reported by many users). This effect is moderated by the CBD content, which is, among other things, a strong anxiolytic and mild sedative. So some started crossbreeding for what became known as "kind bud"; unknowingly growing for a higher CBD content, achieving a more optimal ratio of the two. The high wasn't as intense, but it was far more pleasant.

When THC was first extracted and made legally available as a prescription medication (Marinol, aka dronabinol), most users preferred the crude drug, describing the prescription version as unpleasant and anxiety-inducing. This was because it was pure THC, without the moderating effects of the CBD. It's only in the last decade or so that CBD has begun to be studied as much as THC, and is showing some far more interesting qualities. CBD may possibly be the next "wonder drug" if it can get sufficient interest, and if current research is indicative; far outshadowing the potential of THC.

Not to worry - other Ephedra species grow wild in the American West, like E. nevadensis, which was used to make a concoction called Mormon Tea. They're not as potent as E. sinica, though.

Aside from not being concentrated, natural sources for drugs can vary in potency depending on growing conditions, and that annoying little habit of sexual reproduction that increases the variability.

I think that may be because the active ingredients are in such small doses that they don't have much more than a placebo effect. I recently had a doctor recommend a salve that contains one of the plants known as wolfsbane as its active ingredient: the plant seems to have some anti-inflammatory properties when applied to the skin, but is toxic when ingested.

You're mis-remembering, or the author gave misinformation. CBD does not cause the psychoactive effects that THC does. In fact, it attenuates the psychoactive effects of THC, reducing the intensity of the high. Its primary effects are anxiolytic and anti-spasmodic.

Ghost Hunting Flashlight Trick: Physical Explanation and Experiments
</headline>
<post author="Verklagekasper" datetime="2012-03-25T03:26:00" id="p1">
Some ghost hunters use a flashlight to communicate with ghosts. Typically, the performing ghost hunter turns the flashlight's head to a position where the lamp easily goes on or off by the slightest touch. Then the ghost hunter puts it on a table or on the ground and starts asking questions. Eventually, the flashlight seems to respond by going on or off. The questioning goes on, and the flashlight keeps going on and off without any noticable force affecting it. The ghost hunters claim that the flashlight is operated by a spirit.

But there is a physical explanation for the flashlight repeatedly going on and off by itself. The video below presents experiments with the Mini Maglite 2-Cell AA (Xenon), which happens to be the model used in the TV-Show "Ghost Hunters" that made the trick popular. Experimental results and considerations of contact physics reveal that the trick is actually caused by a heat cycle.

In particular, the cycling is caused by the flashlight's reflector expanding under the heat of the lamp and contracting when the lamp is off, thereby breaking or making contact as it is reducing or increasing pressure on the switch. The long and distinct on and off phases of the cycle are caused by complex events on the contact surfaces. First, when the lamp is off, some pressure is required to break the insulating layers of oxide and other debris that cover the contact surfaces. The lamp stays off until the reflector contracted far enough so that the spring in the tail cap inflicts enough pressure on the contacts to break the oxide layers. When the layers break, the first point of electric contact overheats, melts and spreads, and the contacts get welded together. As the lamp goes on, the reflector starts expanding from the heat of the lamp. It expands until it generated enough force to break the welded spot. Depending on the quality of the weld, the lamp either goes off quickly, as the contact surfaces jump apart, or it goes off flickering, as a bridge of molten metal is formed between the contacts which burns out. After the lamp goes off and the contacts start closing again, it takes some time to remake contact. Because if the surfaces jumped apart when the welded contact spot broke, the resulting gap needs to be closed again. In any case, pressure on the contacts needs to be built up again to break the oxide layers, which either grew back instantly after the weld broke or which got even worse by the oxidization and degredation of the liquid contact bridge. As contact is remade, the cycle starts again.

It's very similar to the technique for "PK powered" demonstrations involving little paper pinwheels. The things are so light and so easily affected by any extremely minute movements of air, that all the performer has to do is to pretend to be the agent causing the thing to move or change direction.

You must not be a "fan" of Ghost Hunters or their copycat fans. I usually torture myself watching these shows to see what rot they get up to.

While most of us knew the basics of how it worked, I'm so glad a detailed and professional analysis of this was made. It needs to be passed through the paranormal community to educate people that have watched one too many episodes of Ghost Hunters.

Of course there will always be some that will say "but our light really was turned on and off by a ghost".

Thank you! <img src="http://forums.randi.org/images/smilies/smile.gif"/> By the way, the psychological aspects of the trick are quite interesting as well. The performers seem honestly convinced that the flashlight (or rather the ghost) is reacting on them, though basically all they do is questioning or commanding until something happens. Sometimes they even just paraphrase their words to get a desired hit, as if the ghost was a slow understander. If the lamp does not react or if it goes on at the wrong time, eg. while they are chatting, that's just ignored or chuckled about. They also adjust their pace to that of the flashlight, eg. every change of the flashlight's state is followed by a period of thanks and chatting before they continue asking. Still, they think it's the flashlight which is adjusting to them.

I'm ambivalent. It's true that bill collectors are aggressive and sometimes walk a fine line of what is appropriate. But let's also not pretend that the people owing the bills are these saints and act appropriately, either. It's basically like you have to be a dirtbag to deal with dirtbags.

Not really, student loans, VA home loans, SBA loans, etc is money owed to the tax payers. The Government has an obligation to the tax payers to collect this money.

The private sector has other avenues to collect the money owed to them, The Government should not be involved in nor worried about money owed to the private sector. Unless you want the Government to enact more regulations on the private sector.

absolutely, There's lots of regulations that could and should be done away with. That's not to say all regulations, some of them are needed.

The money they collect should go back to the department it was borrowed from so other people can use it, ie VA loans go back to the VA so the next Veteran can buy a house. Same with Student loans, SBA loans etc... Why do you have a problem with that?

As for the private sector, they made the loans to make money and the Government/Tax Payers should not be concerned with it. If a company makes loans they can't collect on and goes out of business then so be it. The tax payers should not be concerned with it.

Private firms contracted by the tax payers to collect money owed to them. I don't see a big problem with that. If people take responsibility for themselves and pay their debts we wouldn't need to do this.

Whats this "extra-power to harass people" you're talking about?
Lots of people use cell phones instead of land lines.

Uh, that's the point. I don't have a problem with making sure all the money that is owed anyone is obtained for them. That's called fairness. Whereas, you only are concerned about making sure the money that is owed government is obtained for them. Then you say "taxpayers shouldn't concerned with private business." Too true. But then taxpayers shouldn't be concerned with private business at all, including regulations and the tax monies payed by them. See, when it comes to taking from private business, you're all in and enthusiastic. When it comes to, for once, helping private business, suddenly you're like "woah woah woah...is this the role of the government??" That's hilarious.

Why do you want the tax payers to spend money to ensure that, oh, the payday loan place, or BofA or some used car lot gets money they loaned payed back to them. Whats in it for the tax payers? How very LIBERAL of you to be all concerned about fairness and all.

I did read it. The only thing I see that's different then now is the cell phone thing.

The debt collectors can robocall someone's land line now, they just added cell phones since more and more people are doing away with land line phones.

The way I see it, is the person that borrowed that student loan owes me money. They borrowed tax payer money, I pay taxes so they owe me money and I want it payed back so someone else can use it to better themselves.

What are you talking about? Spend what money? All we're talking about is allowing bill collectors the ability to harrass the people who owe money. And as for "how LIBERAL of you to be all concerned about fairness," wrong. Liberals -- as you have just demonstrated -- are never concerned about fairness. Fairness is the furthest thing from liberalism. Nothing liberal is ever fair, it's just fair "as defined by me."

The only point I have seen you make is that you want the Government to not only go after the money that is owed from student loans etc, but you also want the Government to go after the money owed to the private sector so joes car lot don't have to take responsibility for collecting it himself.

No, my point is simple. Any practice that is fair game for a government bill collector to perform should be fair game for a private bill collector to perform. That is, if they can harrass people who owe money with robocalls to cell phones, then so should the private industry. Hope you understand what we're arguing about now, friend.

Don't the private bill collectors do that now. If you owe money they call your phone and if they had your cell no. they would call that also. So that's not anything new. I seem to remember you libs whining about this a few years ago so they could only call during certain times or something like that.

I couldn't disagree with you two any more.

Whether public or private, there is risk of default in any sort of credit line or loan and that's specifically why parties negotiate penalties for defaults. While there is a stigma attached to it, there's absolutely nothing wrong with looking at the conditions of a loan and choosing to default if that's a better option then paying it back. Two parties are needed to negotiate a deal and it doesn't make anyone a dirtbag for choosing their best option nor should they be subjected to legalized harassment. The U.S. government has given collection agencies carte blanche ability to harass people in default and that's wrong. Creditors presumably negotiate their contracts in good faith and need to live with the consequences if someone defaults - it's usually their terms we're agreeing with, not the other way around!

What I said is that the wackjob right is all out of kilter about robocalling the cellphones of people who owe the feds money, because Obama supports it, while unaware that the Republicans have a bill that would allow the same debt collectors to robocall anyone.

Sarah Palin Making sense? Who would guess

So maligned is Sarah Palin, that if and when she might say something incredibly insightful, most observers, especially those who play "gotcha" with her would completely miss it.

When she punctuates a speech with the fact that seven of the ten richest counties in America surround DC as a demonstration that "serving" government has become a get rich quick scheme, you need to pay attention.

Known for her swipes at the "lamestream" media, she seems to have documented that point as all but one reporter seems to have missed one of, if not the most poignant speeches of this political season.

Before people start jumping down my throat, I find Sarah Palin an astonishing curiosity and phenomenon, but believe she would make only a slightly better president than Owebama, which is to say a miniature disaster.

However, she gores the established political establishment on both sides in what has to be the most unpartisan speeches in recent memory and should, but it won't, rank up there with Eisenhower's "military industrial complex" speech.

<quote>
She made three interlocking points. First, that the United States is now governed by a ?permanent political class,? drawn from both parties, that is increasingly cut off from the concerns of regular people. Second, that these Republicans and Democrats have allied with big business to mutual advantage to create what she called ?corporate crony capitalism.? Third, that the real political divide in the United States may no longer be between friends and foes of Big Government, but between friends and foes of vast, remote, unaccountable institutions (both public and private).

As respectable as Dana Priest is, she is not a leader and founder of the Tea Party, rather the other end of the spectrum. And that, I suggest, makes one hell of a big difference.

And I was not aware that Priest has lashed out with an across the board salvo at everyone in elected office. In fact it was my impression she's rather enamored with Nancy Pelosi and Owebama......

I've never once suggested that Sarah Palin hasn't been successful.

But I don't think being smart is a necessary prerequsite of success.

My contention is that Sarah Palin is not smart, and I maintain it.

The woman is as stupid as a box of hammers.

My wife isn't a public figure. She isn't as successful as Sarah Palin. She hasn't been a governor, but she's never run for elected office and has no real interest in politics. She hasn't written a book but, again, she's never tried. She has published papers. She hasn't done "TV specials" but she has been on television a handful of times. She isn't a FOX contributor.

Sarah Palin is also 11 years older than my wife, so we're not really comparing apples and oranges. When Palin was my wife's age she was the team hockey mom and teaching Eskimos how to pull a voting lever.

What a difference a decade makes.

My wife is also a lot hotter than Sarah Palin, and note that I am not suggesting that Sarah Palin isn't hot, she is, it's just that she's not as hot as my wife. <img src="http://www.uspoliticsonline.com/images/smilies/wink.gif"/>

It is to bad liberals harassed her and her family with meaningless bullshit lawsuits that it forced her to leave office cause it was taking away from the state.......She at least knew it was better for the state to have a Governor that wouldn't have to be in court every week cause some progressive scumbag.

Sure. It's happened to a lot of governors. They don't quit. She quit because she was a national figure now and there was money to be made. I don't hold it against her. She's making money now. I don't think she has any intention of running for President.

I always find it funny that making money is suppose to be a bad thing LOL. By the way it doesn't happen to a lot of Governors. It does now though since the spineless progressive realized how easy it is. The major difference is that in Alaska she had to pay for her legal defense. Unlike most other Governors.

Known for her swipes at the "lamestream" media, she seems to have documented that point as all but one reporter seems to have missed one of, if not the most poignant speeches of this political season.

Before people start jumping down my throat, I find Sarah Palin an astonishing curiosity and phenomenon, but believe she would make only a slightly better president than Owebama, which is to say a miniature disaster.

However, she gores the established political establishment on both sides in what has to be the most unpartisan speeches in recent memory and should, but it won't, rank up there with Eisenhower's "military industrial complex" speech.

Sarah Palin is not to be taken seriously. I resent the implication that we liberals play "gotcha" with her words when it is her words that do it to herself. All one needs to do is repeat the shit she says verbatim and you find yourself laughing at how absurd most of it is.

I especially resent anyone who pretends they stand for the common man when they're political philosophy says that we should let Wall Street bankrupt us and steal our wealth once more by rescinding regulations and turning a blind eye to clear and present malfeasance being practiced there.

You can't say you want gov't out of people's lives only to get elected and try to regulate your opinion on what freedoms people can have or not have when it comes to decisions being made between patients and doctors, so Sarah Palin has no cred with me and with a lot of other people too, not just liberals, because she doesn't really stand for real things, just the usual baseless assertions that pass for Republican philosophy these days.

I have to echo this. I have yet to see Palin make any terribly original statements or come up with anything that wasn't basically restating what someone else had already come up with.

Her excuse did not include lawsuits. Her claim was that it was about the investigation of ethics violations. The exact same thing could happen to her as president. Essentially what she has done is say that she couldn't take the heat as governor, so we should believe she would be able to take the heat as president?

BTW... soon after she resigned, the laws in Alaska were changed so that the ethics violations she was being investigated for, would no longer be considered ethics violations. Which would of course mean they WERE ethics violations at the time she did them.

If being stupid equals success then I sure wish all the stupid people in this world turn that stupidity into success. Somehow I don't think their stupidity will lead them to success. Especially those that are as stupid as a box of hammers.

My wife isn't a public figure. She isn't as successful as Sarah Palin. She hasn't been a governor, but she's never run for elected office and has no real interest in politics. She hasn't written a book but, again, she's never tried. She has published papers. She hasn't done "TV specials" but she has been on television a handful of times. She isn't a FOX contributor.

Sarah Palin is also 11 years older than my wife, so we're not really comparing apples and oranges. When Palin was my wife's age she was the team hockey mom and teaching Eskimos how to pull a voting lever.

My wife is also a lot hotter than Sarah Palin, and note that I am not suggesting that Sarah Palin isn't hot, she is, it's just that she's not as hot as my wife.

What a difference a decade makes.
</quote>

We'll see won't we, if a decade makes your wife as successful as Palin. Further I might add according to you Palin is as stupid as a box of hammers and your wife is smart. So I would say Palin is severely handicapped. And you say your wife is hotter than Palin, thus your wife is smarter and hotter than Palin so it should make it real easy for her to catch up. In fact I'm really surprised she has not caught up already and passed Palin on the success scale, why in the hell should she need 10 yrs to do it.

Lets compare, Palin is as stupid as a box of hammers and is hot but not that hot. Your wife is extremely smart and is hotter than palin. Yet I see Palin as extremely successful, is there something wrong with this picture. Just asking.

Katie Couric: And when it comes to establishing your worldview, I was curious: what newspapers and magazines did you regularly read before you were tapped for this to stay informed and to understand the world?
Sarah Palin: I've read most of them, again with a great appreciation for the press, for the media.
KC: But, like, what ones specifically? I'm curious.
SP: All of 'em, any of 'em that have been in front of me over all these years.
KC: Can you name a few?
SP: I have a vast variety of sources where we get our news too. Alaska isn't a foreign country, where, it's kind of suggested and it seems like, 'Wow, how could you keep in touch with what the rest of Washington, D.C. may be thinking and doing when you live up there in Alaska?' Believe me, Alaska is like a microcosm of America.

So very true. As to an orginal thought. Its very hard for people to understand the meanning of truth when it comes from the heart. Most all political figures in the light today just keep repeating themselves or what they heard someone else say.

I havn't seen any other polititation put any of their cronies in prsion as Palin did. It didn't make any matter what side of the fence they were on when it come to Palin. They went to jail for their wrong doing. Most dumass liberals don't find that very healthy. <img src="http://www.uspoliticsonline.com/images/smilies/bored.gif"/>

There's still a few pendings in there; but it is a rather old link, so maybe they have all been washed away.

None the less; the fact remains that her inability take the scrutiny of being governor of Alaska does not speak well for her ability to withstand the scrutiny of being POTUS. I'm pretty sure it's a non-issue anyway. She won't run; and if even if by some miracle she does, she will certainly not get the republican nod.

Hey, if Governor Christie was dumb for ordering the evacuations, you'd think the smart Democrats would have done their civic duty and ordered everyone in New Jersey to evacuate to the shores, where Lord Obama would lower the waters to save them all.

This, by the way, is one of the lamest threads I've seen on here.

Gov. Chris Christie screwed up and now is itching for federal aid. Instead ordering the evacuations, he should have been better prepared to fix power lines, roads and bridges. Around 150,000 in New Jersey are still without power and some communities remain flooded. The storm killed seven people in the state.

"New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie joined calls for immediate increases to the FEMA disaster aid budget in the aftermath of Hurricane Irene, slamming fellow Republicans such as House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (Va.) who have called for additional funds to be offset by equivalent spending cuts.

“Our people are suffering now, and they need support now. And [Congress] can all go down there and get back to work and figure out budget cuts later. You’re going to turn it into a fiasco like that debt-limit thing where you’re fighting with each other for eight or nine weeks and you expect the citizens of my state to wait?,” Christie said. “They’re not gonna wait, and I’m going to fight to make sure that they don’t. I don’t want to hear about the fact that offsetting budget cuts have to come first before New Jersey citizens are taken care of.”

You're correct that water is the most serious threat in a hurricane. That said, Christie was absolutely correct to order people--like my parents--off the NJ barrier islands when a hurricane was called for passing just off or directly over the NJ shore areas, including barrier islands.

IMO, NJ did a good job evacuating people from endangered shore areas, a mass progress of FEMA and state and local agencies working together since Katrina. One reason loss of life was so negligible at the shore areas is precisely because evacuations were done well. That's the problems with stats--they can be read correctly or entirely incorrectly. One incorrect reading is that when low to no loss of life is detected afterwards that it means the threat was overstated or false, and that's often not the case. It just as likely, and did here, tells a tale that loss of life was prevented.

There were also some very lucky breaks as to how the hurricane acted at the last moments insofar as the shore points. Weather prediction does have variables in such situations, and it's better to be safe than sorry.

Hurricanes are huge and provide several means of death, and by ordering evacuations, it never meant people were perfectly safe elsewhere. Flood advisories were regularly given in areas inland where flooding was predicted before, during and afterwards. Many choose to assume the risks of that or merely suffered what is an unfortunate result of a natural disaster.

I think it is dumb of Christie to now be whining about congress being political about spending billions on disaster aid. NJ should pay for its own cleanup, and that is the conservative position. The US govt should not be borrowing money to pay NJ to cleanup from a natural disaster. FEMA is unconstitutional anyway.

I think he's spot on. And to be frank, I have little patience, like him, hearing calls that people in the regions be given the debt excuse, especially when the same types are cheap fucks on taxes, etc.

My region didn't think twice about helping Katrina victims from TX to FL and elsewhere and in other hurricane that usually strike elsewhere with FEMA funds or when the Mississippi River areas flooded, etc. That's true even when your state gets into trouble with fires, floods, e.g.

EMA Administrator declares a major disaster aid for Arizona

A major disaster for Arizona declared
by Craig Fugate
Craig Fugate Administrator of DHS's FEMA announced that aid is available to the state of Arizona for local recovery in the area affected by severe storms and floods.

The head of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Craig Fugate announced that federal aid is available to the state of Arizona to supplement state and local recovery efforts in the area struck by severe storms and flooding during the period of July 20 to August 7, 2010.

Federal funding is available to state and eligible local governments and certain private nonprofit organizations on a cost-sharing basis for emergency work and the repair or replacement of facilities damaged by the severe storms and flooding in Coconino County.

Federal funding is also available on a cost-sharing basis for hazard mitigation measures statewide.

FEMA named Sandy Coachman as the Federal Coordinating Officer for federal recovery operations in the affected area. Coachman said: "Additional designations may be made at a later date if requested by the state of Arizona and warranted by the results of further damage assessments."

That's because this is America, and fellow Americans should come to each others assistance when disasters happen whether natural or man-made. We've never made a stink.

<a href="http://www.thebigredguide.com/news/fema-administrator-declares-a-major-disaster-for-arizona.html">FEMA Administrator declares a major disaster aid for Arizona | Fire News - TheBigRedGuide</a>

The Mid-Atlantic and New England regions are huge contributors to the federal funding, a region in fact that does plenty of covering for other states that are net losses in the 'give-and-take' analysis of federal funding. To hear this when it's unfortunately 'our turn' to suffer a major loss in a major disaster is not well received in this area at all and tells much about some attitudes of some people in other areas of this country...Christie is far from alone in saying so.

So we should have left New Orleans swim in the swamp created therein? Denied her relief personally that she received? Left all the MS and LA bridges in ruins in the bays, etc? Left all the infrastructure in piles? Denied people food and water, etc? Denied them medical and other emergency assistance? Let your state keep housing them in your stadium and other places?

Or maybe left Galveston a pile of rubble with Gustav with the same results?

Of course. But it's more than just that. For those who can't think anymore than what's personally in it for them in anything and have neither a sense of patriotic duty or Christian duty in them despite how much I hear the same types cite both like they're dipped into fountains of that, it's an issue of self-interest as well. The nation cannot function properly with segments of it in ruins due to natural or man-made disasters. It hurts the economy, stresses the affected regions and flows to others with migrations, lost business, etc. Sooner or later such disasters hit everywhere, so such an attitude eventually will leave most places a pile of destroyed shit due to different disasters.

But it shouldn't even have to get to that--it's very telling about the state of this country IMO when citizens--and I use that term unfortunately technically rather than substantively given the lack of patriotic duty in so many towards each other these days--look at each other with predatory and selfish eyes as they are with these kinds of 'debates.'

When someone hits NY or VA with planes, I don't think that's NY's and VA's problem. I see that as the US getting attacked and we're all in it. When I see Hurricanes like Andrew, Floyd, Katrina or Gustav creating massive victims getting windswept, flooded and otherwise destroyed and imperilled, I don't see FL, NC, TX, LA or MS folks and shrugg my shoulders thinking "That's their fucking problem." When I see fires burning up CA or AZ, I don't think the same thing. Those are fellow Americans in a disaster scenario and they need help most of all from fellow Americans. Shame on the nation if it loses its basic decency and sense of loyalty to fellow citizens--it's not a country at all if it lacks that as the glue that binds the people together, and certainly forget all the jibber-jabber of any kind and character of the 'God' they claim exists has any place in it.

Sure, i am totally with you on that - and its not even like the states are getting a handout on this issue, as the residents do pay taxes to the federal government, and if not in emergencies like this, when would it ever be appropriate to give federal aid? That was what i meant by my comment of paying taxes and not getting the benfits...if not now, then would there ever be a scenario anyone would envision where aid would be appropriate?

I'm not sure if we're talking over each other here but we're pretty much in agreement. Even if Texas didn't get hammered by storms every season i'd still be in favor of Federal aid to disaster victims, and like you cited its not just weather or climactic. The issue of terrorism had brought that to the forefront as well. One of the first things that George Bush said after the attacks was that the full respurces of the federal government would be made available to deal with the recovery (From the disaster). The whole thing just goes without saying.

The problem--one that is a big problem IMO--is that it should go without saying because no citizen should be even expected to be so depraved of mind and void of civic duty or, if they hold it, religious duty--to want to be dismissive of assisting in these matters. But now it has to be said, and worse, has to now even be argued as some kind of reasonable difference of opinion.

The deterioration of national obligations to each other can and is already being taken to comprehensive levels. For example, should a citizen tell another that being swamped with drug and human traffickers across the TX border be your problem and not really my problem, or because it might not affect me as much as you (for the sake of the argument--I don't agree with it) that it's 'tough shit' for you? And the same with mass influxes of illegal workers putting kids in your school and jumping into your hospitals with no insurance or cash, etc? Or maybe if a Texan gets arrested abroad that it's Texas that should deal with it? Or maybe you should just bury your own National Guard soldiers given they are 'TX militia' etc?

It will ruin this country IMO when such sense of basic duties to other citizens gets eroded where each is a predatory threat and bother to each other to be kept at arm's length and in cold dealings. That's not a nation. It's just a boarding house of people with no sense of loyalty and duty to each other. We've been down that road before--it led to a Civil War. The result was supposed to create a nation.

Well those views are certainly not coming from me and while i agree it can be divisive i'm not entirely sure why the complaints are being thrown at me...the views also seem to be that of a minority of individuals would rather see FEMA or any other agency not help. Heartfelt as the angst may be, it may be better aimed at someone who has actually advocated witholding funds and what not.

As for the stuff about Texas its not usually me who has a gripe with the state when we act unilaterally but then again if we're going to the semantics of it, it was actually Texas counties that were refused a federal aid during recent fires and subsequent droughts through the worst summer in the state's history, even after declarations of states of emergency. If we wanted to i'm sure we could unilaterally act on the issue of immigration as well, and when it becomes "our problem" the whinning and complaints almost always come from the Feds and do gooding bleeding hearts who have sympathy to illegals. We don't act at the request of the federal Government, not because of some apparent whim to suck of the Government teat.

As for the first part, i do agree it should go without saying and i can understand your frustrations that it isn't, but that isn't coming from me and concerns would be better suited blasting them instead.

Quite right. Basic duties to other citizens. Not illegal immigrants who, by there very presence in the country, are criminals, and by all rights need to be deported, and, incidentally, are not citizens.

As for helping other citizens in the time of disasters, it's the distribution of risks and costs, and really shouldn't be criticized, as one day you may very well be in need of a hand up in similar situations. You just don't know.

Cantor in tricky spot on disaster aid
By Mike Lillis - 08/31/11 06:50 AM ET

House Majority Leader Eric Cantor’s (R-Va.) insistence that federal disaster aid be offset elsewhere in the budget runs directly counter to his position in the past when the money went to help his district.

In the summer of 2004, after Tropical Storm Gaston slammed into Richmond, Cantor was on the front lines of efforts to secure millions of dollars in federal assistance to clean the wreckage and repair damaged infrastructure. Although the funding was not offset, Cantor cheered its arrival.

“The magnitude of the damage suffered by the Richmond area is beyond what the Commonwealth can handle,” Cantor said in a news release at the time, “and that is why I asked the president to make federal funds available for the citizens affected by Gaston.”

Then all of a sudden, pandering to the most malicious and reckless aspects of the Tea Party along with the saner and more constructively intended ones, he became politically calculating to his personal aspirations within the GOP, never mind nationally, where he'd take any tea--whether sweet or rotten--so long as it was poured in his glass. He then started pandering to the biggest, clueless, soulless and most unpatriotic 'tea party patriots' by developing cheap pockets towards the Joplin tornado catastrophe and now Hurricane Irene victims. It's par for the course of this asshole, e.g., bashing the stimulus but taking its money and lauding it for creating jobs and infrastructure with the high-speed rail line in his district. That hypocrisy I can handle as routine hypocrisy, but when it comes to leaving Americans in peril, fuck him...hope the son of a bitch gets a swollen asshole and the insurance company denies him coverage as a pre-existing condition. (metaphorically speaking of course as I wish him no personal harm but that's effectively what's he's doing to others in how he's behaving)

Absolutely on the second sentence....but we're getting worse, not better, IMO, in respects of civil duties and solving basic problems, which ties into the first sentence.

You wrote in the first sentence: "Not illegal immigrants who, by there very presence in the country, are criminals,..." Guess what? They're not, at least standing by itself. Why? Because currently under US law, it's not a crime to be knowingly illegally present in the US. Common sense ought to dictate that it should be a criminal act and something fixed as part of a comprehensive immigration reform and settlement package to help discourage and punish future illegal residency here, but it's not.

This nation can't even solve a fundamental problems like the massive illegal immigrant situation and fixing it with a plan that works going forward. For all the big talk and shitty games, they've done absolutely jack shit towards fixing that problem except for some increased enforcement of deporting those caught in the criminal system for criminal acts and some stepped up border patrolling that need more help. Instead, all I see is a bunch of grandstanding and political games rather than comprehensive by the parties and picking particular sides to wind up and piss off so they can get people to vote against the other. And the American public IMO is acting the big chump for them by going along with this rather than demanding the situation be fixed with a compromise and pathway going forward that actually works to keep it from being repeated in the future.

To me, the problem seems in their calculations to be better unresolved or done half-arsed that serves an interest politically rather than actually comprehensively fixing the problem. To them, it's a 'gift that keeps on giving' so why bother fixing it where it becomes moot?

For example, I think the DREAM Act is a good and right thing to do for several reasons given all the facts of them, our defaults, what we can get from it, etc. I'm amenable to some relief with conditions for those well settled here where it's fair under the circumstances and serves our interests too given the country has had unclean hands in how they've handled--or should I say mishandled--immigration issues. But IMO it should be part of a package comprehensive settlement so that situation is not repeated. IMO, we don't need another mass influx of illegals. Instead, we need Americans with jobs and legal immigrants and a pathway created to allow those we desire and need rather than this horrible 'closed legal/open illegal' practice designed to screw over Americans and immigrants alike for the benefit of the unscrupulous screwing everyone else collectively.

I'll tell you who will be working to clean up much of this mess whilst these kinds of anti-social and self-defeating and destructive debates are occurring...illegal immigrants who work cheaper than Americans who also need a job--not because they want to, but because they have to, and that's getting even more than Americans who don't get the job at all. And some unscrupulous employers will be cashing in improperly with that same old game. In this employment market, I'd think quite a few people would like to have that work. But hell, why spend a dime on that so others argue helping others rebuild for our collective good and civic duty?

Welcome to America--the place where your US citizen neighbour calls himself a patriot but doesn't wish to help you whilst they sit unemployed, but an illegal immigrant will work to help that neighbour and rebuild the country, and yet is called a criminal rather than a patriot. God bless America...it's exactly what those before us worked so hard for us to leave as our legacy with what was given to us. <img src="http://www.uspoliticsonline.com/images/smilies/rolleyes.gif"/>

In other words, it was reported by every weather station and news outlet that Hurricane Irene was going to devastate the East Coast, specifically the mid-Atlantic states. Governor Christie subsequently orders an evacuation, which retrospectively is called "dumb." Where were all the people calling it "dumb" AT THE TIME? Why didn't you guys and the people writing these articles immediately start demanding that people stay at the coastal areas, like the "smart" people would?

It is interesting that nobody is ripping on liberal Mayor Bloomberg of New York City, who evacuated New York City. He's apparently "smart" because he's not a conservative.

Then this question comes up of how Christie should have "been better prepared to fix power lines, roads and bridges." Oh? How should he have prepared for that? I bet you have no idea. You're just one of those people who sit around saying "they should make it so that power never goes out" and then sits back all self-satisfied and nodding to yourself.

By the way, there's this discussion -- and I didn't have time yet to read through all the posts -- about whether Christie is a hypocrite for asking for federal funds for New Jersey. The answer is no. I've been on other Internet forums and this argument is always made (primarily by liberals), but it's a false argument.

People always demand that others -- be it individuals or states -- be "true" to their conservative beliefs when it comes to RECEIVING money. But they never allow them to be "true" to their conservative beliefs when it comes to GIVING money. In other words, there's an analogous argument where "conservatives should never take unemployment benefits or be on welfare." Why? The conservative is never allowed to be conservative by not paying taxes, are they? So the demand is that, to be "true" to conservatism you must take TWO hits: the one when liberals come and take your money and the second by refusing any benefit from the taxes you paid. That's a specious argument.

Now, if you could, as a conservative, refuse to pay those taxes, then ABSOLUTELY you would be a hypocrite to take benefits. ABSOLUTELY. But so long as you are forced to participate in the "social contract," then you are absolutely able to take the benefits of said contract. Even while railing against that contract.

Gov. Christie did just what he was suppose to do, unlike the moronic former-Gov. Blanco and former-Mayor Nagin who waited until tropical storm conditions were upon us to call for an mandatory evacuation. Be thankful that only seven people were killed in N.J. because six years later, we still do not have an exact death toll from Katrina but we know that it was over 1400 in Louisiana alone.
There is no magic wand to fix power lines, roads and bridges so I don't know how Gov. Christie could have been "better prepared" to fix them. I'm sure crews from all over the nation are working very hard to restore power as they did during Katrina but it takes time. Nearly 900,000 were without power in Louisiana alone and I was lucky enough to have mine restored in 13 days...it's only been a week for N.J., hardly time enough to repair everything.
I'm not sure where you live but obviously you haven't a clue about what happens during before, during and after a hurricane or else you wouldn't complain that Gov. Christie did exactly what was needed. My hat is off to to all the authorities along the east coast who acted in the best interest of the citizens of those states because many lives were saved due to their actions. Power lines, roads and bridges can be repaired but the dead cannot be revived.

My region didn't think twice about helping Katrina victims from TX to FL and elsewhere and in other hurricane that usually strike elsewhere with FEMA funds or when the Mississippi River areas flooded, etc. That's true even when your state gets into trouble with fires, floods, e.g.

<a href="http://www.thebigredguide.com/news/fema-administrator-declares-a-major-disaster-for-arizona.html">FEMA Administrator declares a major disaster aid for Arizona | Fire News - TheBigRedGuide</a>

The Mid-Atlantic and New England regions are huge contributors to the federal funding, a region in fact that does plenty of covering for other states that are net losses in the 'give-and-take' analysis of federal funding. To hear this when it's unfortunately 'our turn' to suffer a major loss in a major disaster is not well received in this area at all and tells much about some attitudes of some people in other areas of this country...Christie is far from alone in saying so.

The nation cannot function properly with segments of it in ruins due to natural or man-made disasters. It hurts the economy, stresses the affected regions and flows to others with migrations, lost business, etc. Sooner or later such disasters hit everywhere, so such an attitude eventually will leave most places a pile of destroyed shit due to different disasters.

But it shouldn't even have to get to that--it's very telling about the state of this country IMO when citizens--and I use that term unfortunately technically rather than substantively given the lack of patriotic duty in so many towards each other these days--look at each other with predatory and selfish eyes as they are with these kinds of 'debates.'

When someone hits NY or VA with planes, I don't think that's NY's and VA's problem. I see that as the US getting attacked and we're all in it. When I see Hurricanes like Andrew, Floyd, Katrina or Gustav creating massive victims getting windswept, flooded and otherwise destroyed and imperilled, I don't see FL, NC, TX, LA or MS folks and shrugg my shoulders thinking "That's their fucking problem." When I see fires burning up CA or AZ, I don't think the same thing. Those are fellow Americans in a disaster scenario and they need help most of all from fellow Americans. Shame on the nation if it loses its basic decency and sense of loyalty to fellow citizens--it's not a country at all if it lacks that as the glue that binds the people together, and certainly forget all the jibber-jabber of any kind and character of the 'God' they claim exists has any place in it.

Again, strawman. When someone (in this case enemies of the country) hit NY with planes, that is an act of war, and the federal govt is required to be involved. There job is to prevent such attacks. That has absolutely no similarity to a weather event. The federal govts job is to protect the country from invasion, and ensure justice.

Now, if you want to pass a constitutional amendment making it the job of the federal govt to protect people from weather, and cleanup afterwards, then you are welcome to try.

Furthermore, you are right that I have no patriotism. I dont want to be a citizen of the US. So leave me out of it.

Again, that's not a strawman as it expressed my POV on civic duties. If you wish to view the 9.11 comment as different for what you're saying, that's fine because there is a difference there between that and weather. My point comes from how IMO Americans ought to view calamitous situations overall concerning other Americans whether it be man made or natural.

As for FEMA, you can call it unconstitutional all you want. I disagree, but what matters is what a court says about it. I don't have to do anything...it already exists and you're bound by it so long as it exists. Rather, since it's your claim, it's up to you or any others making such a claim to raise that challenge in court with you carrying the burden to prove to their satisfaction that it's unconstitutional, and it's a heavy burden to overcome given the presumption of constitutionality given by the courts for which you must overcome in such challenges.

Likewise, you don't wish to be a US citizen, but you are one whether you like it or not unless and until you acquire a Certificate of Loss of Nationality from the State Department, which is difficult to obtain unless you are already a citizen and/or guaranteed to be settled by that country that accepts you and you renounce your citizenship in a US consulate abroad or other very extraordinary acts like fighting against the US for a foreign enemy. Unless or until that is achieved, you are bound by all the obligations of US citizenship and can be criminally and/or civilly sanctioned for failing to do so. And even if you weren't a US citizen, as long as you reside in the US, you're still bound by the obligations of residency, and that includes paying taxes, obeying FEMA, etc.

IMO, Christie isn't a hypocrite for an even simpler reason--he doesn't oppose FEMA relief and, in fact, is irritated that it's even suggested to be a political chip when others got the help before with NJ tax dollars and support but now NJ being in time of need this time gets resistance instead.

<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoKv-1m-g_8">Governor Chris Christie: They Need Support Now - YouTube</a>

Reading your overall points, there's plenty of merit to it but I'd offer some provisos. I agree with your specific example given it concerns money if that position is advocated by the person up front and not as damage control once caught doing the opposite when advocating otherwise without that explanation. People are entitled to the benefit of their bargain, even if they believe it is a rough or bad bargain and wish to change it in part or full, and it's fair to take that approach so long as it's said up front. Ron Paul does that for example insofar as his approach to spending requests. He'll state right up front if he thinks a certain approach or bill shouldn't pass but also state if it does he's also putting in his requests to see that his constituents get the benefit of the bargain he doesn't think is wise overall. I'm perfectly fine with that except for one other proviso I'll mention in the end.

But let's take the case of a 'family values' type person who preaches that stuff for votes and then gets caught in an airport toilet getting sex, or having a young mistress or having secret kids with mistresses or getting caught with prostitutes or using drugs when railing against drugs, etc. There's been plenty of those types and IMO they're hypocrites, even if what they did was legal. That's because they never explained things the 'Ron Paul' way if you will and held themselves totally accountable to their approaches and conduct with the public, most likely because they like the benefits of not playing it straight with people.

As for the second proviso citing the 'Ron Paul' approach, it's also key that the statement be sincere. I'm fully aware that politicians can also look to have it both ways by voting and taking stances with slick strategy in mind seeking to get it both ways on benefits and accountabilities. For example, some politicians can and do vote 'yes' to things they really don't want or 'no' to things they really want but do so under conditions they know will pass or fail regardless of their vote, and then they collect and/or capitalise on any benefits from it with someone else taking any heats for it and allowing them to have it both ways on acts and rhetoric. That IMO is another example of a hypocrite and lack of a straight talker and honest broker.

Given I'm not a mind reader, judging sincerity on that more or less comes from educated guesses observing the totality of the circumstances such as their overall record of statements, actions and demeanour, etc. For example, knowing Ron Paul's overall record, demeanour, rhetoric, etc, I believe him far more often than not. Others, however, strike me as more slick and insincere based on their totality of circumstances.

To me, it really boils down to the old saw " Say what you mean and mean what you say " and the old court oath " Do you swear or affirm to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help me God " (traditional US version) or " I swear by God, the Almighty and Omniscient, that I will speak the pure truth, and will withhold and add nothing " (traditional British Commonwealth version) (boldings added). Whether I agree or not with whatever that is, I can at least say the person played it straight with me.

But I think the two of you are basically having two different arguments. You are arguing that Christie doesn't oppose FEMA relief and therefore is consistent WITH HIMSELF. Whereas jviehe is arguing that Christie, by being for FEMA relief for anyone, is being inconsistent with a purely conservative ideology. My point is that even if he is being inconsistent with a conservative ideology, it is not inconsistent in the context of the constraints of the government Christie is forced to function in. (Which is why I asked if anyone had read my post, not because I was attention whoring, lol.)

Absolutely. But that's completely different from the fiscal "hypocrisy" because nobody is forcing you to act in a socially liberal manner. (I don't know what a social analogy would be to forcing you to pay taxes in an inequitable manner, actually.)

True, we have different POVs on that. I agree with your POV with those provisos in mind. So long as the person explains their views along what you said sincerely and in full so the public can judge that and it removes the kind of bs I described, it's fine by me. In fact, I'd even suggest that it would often be a letdown to constituents to do otherwise and not take a 'second best' alternative or 'mitigate damages' from that representative's POV where that presents itself. As for attention whoring, this is Saturday not Sunday so today's the day to get that in...stick and shake some leg out there.... <img src="http://www.uspoliticsonline.com/images/smilies/lol.gif"/>

</quote>

It is indeed different IMO for reasons explained IMO but those provisos really matter in it insofar as the 'conservative' part. For example, if someone is merely being slick and going the extra mile in larding up a bill with big spending knowing it's going to pass anyway over a 'no' vote, that's merely getting into insincerity IMO if they're claiming to stand for fiscal conservativeness playing that game and not being up front about it. And even if they are not being hypocritical if they stated their alternative strategy up front like they should to be an honest broker with the public on what they stand for, it might affect their fiscal conservative claims depending how much they press in the alternative if they really go hog wild with the alternative. It's one thing to merely try to get the benefit of tax money being spent by constituents in the alternative so they don't 'lose twice' by effectively 'donating' it to the opposed bill's purposes and getting no return benefit at all and quite another if playing the 'trash and cash' game. It's more or less something that has to be viewed for each person and what they're saying and doing to spot who is being fair and square and who is talking out both sides of their mouth with the approach I suggested.

Do you have a driver lic? If so then you had to follow the laws to obtain it.
You joined this forum and there are laws as to it's use.
I could be wrong, but aren't you the one that wanted to exterminate old people, including your parents because you didn't want to pay SS tax?

I'm sure you can find another country better to your liking.
Tell you what I'll do, I'll give you one month, find another country to move to and I'll be happy to buy you a one way ticket there. The only condition is that you have to renounce your US citizenship and never return. We'll have OSB draw up all the legal papers and it's a done deal. How about it?

Strawman. I dont have a problem with Law. I have a problem with the USA. And as I have an unalienable right to liberty I can remove myself from a social contract at any time. No one owns me or my property so I dont have to move. And I think you missed the part where I am a free person, so none of your conditions or legal papers apply unless I consent.

Finally, yes, I want to exeterminate old people including my parents. Thats exactly what I said.

I'm not quite sure what you think your posts are accomplishing in this regard. Frankly, nobody really cares if you want to kill your parents or whatever. I'm sure your parents wouldn't be thrilled but that's about it.

What I'm getting at, in case you don't get it, is that you're not even communicating any thoughts in any coherent manner.

I think Ive been pretty calm and logical. No where did I yell or have a tantrum even when told to get out and that i wanted to kill my parents. Now, I could simply respond to your insults in kind, but in case youre actully interested in a debate, Ill restate the argument.

The topic is partly about the role of FEMA, which I think is unconstitutional given the constitution does not say anything about congress having the power to spend money on natural disaster response. Since many people think the govt should be involved regardless, OSB implied that if you dont think the federal govt should mange natural disaster issues you are somehow unpatriotic.

To which I agreed in spirit. Since the USA has broken the social contract, and I have an unalienable right to liberty, I decided to terminate the contract, and thus am no longer legally bound by federal law, and thus do not owe alleigance or patriotism.

Now, youve only been on this forum a short time, so Ill cut you some slack. If you want to continue to participate here, stick to the topic, and leave the emotion and personal attacks out of it. If you cant, use the ignore button, as you will soon end up on mine.

There's no daylight between Barack Obama and Chris Christie. Black victims of the flood demand: "Show us the money!"

"After Air Force One landed at Newark Liberty International Airport, Mr. Obama, a Democrat, was greeted warmly by Gov. Chris Christie, a Republican. Mr. Obama flew by helicopter to Essex County Airport and then headed to flood-stricken Passaic County. One person along his car route held up a sign that pleaded, “Help Us.” Standing alongside the Passaic River, Mr. Obama praised Mr. Christie, FEMA personnel and local officials for their farsightedness in responding to the storm, saying that their response “helped to avert even worse tragedies.” Mr. Christie has had nothing but praise for the president in recent days, complimenting his administration’s focused response to the storm."

9.1 percent Unemployment

Hrmm.. How come when uneployment goes down its BETTER then EXPECTED, and when it goes up its UNEXPECTED... I am curious what is EXPECTED.....

Anyway...

The economy needs twice as many net jobs per month to rapidly reduce unemployment. The rate has topped 9 percent in every month except two since the recession officially ended in June 2009.

We have the LOWEST particiapation in teh job market in over 25 years!!! WTF.. People just giving up looking for work, and Obama will come out today and say LOOOK UMEPLOYMENT IS DOWN!!!

lol...

WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hiring picked up slightly in July and the unemployment rate dipped to 9.1 percent. The modest improvement may quiet fears of another recession a day after Wall Street posted its worst losses in nearly three years.

Employers added 117,000 jobs last month, the Labor Department said Friday. That's better than the past two months, which were also revised higher.

The better-than-expected report gave stocks a small lift one day after the Dow Jones industrial average fell more than 500 points. The Dow jumped as much as 171 points when the market opened, but then erase most gains to rise only 31 points in early-morning trading.

"These numbers are not great," said Ian Shepherdson, an economist at High Frequency Economics, in a note to clients. "But they are a long way from recession territory."

How are those spending cuts and tax decreases working for you? Is it time to finally put the argument to rest that the way to create jobs is to lower taxes on high income earners and to cut spending? If the GOP got "98%" of what they wanted in the deficit package, are they responsible for 98% of the 500pt DOW drop yesterday?

It's a pretty simply philosophy, CSA. If you manage to lower expectations so much that pretty much anybody with a brain thinks "it can't possibly get any worse" then absolutely anything positive is, by definition, better than expected and anything negative is, also by definition, unexpected.

Again, the key to this whole thing is to make sure that expectations move continually lower and that they get smacked down every time they improve. Failure to do this results in a lot more "unexpected" stuff and that tends to make people feel bad about themselves.

As always. You refuse to acknowledge what got us to this point. Democrats and Republicans bent us all over and fucked us raw without so much as a reach around or lube. The 500pt DOW drop is the market attempting to correct itself. The current high that it's at now is illusory. We NEVER recovered. The spending has to go. It is time for America to pay its debts and focus on paying its debts. We are bankrupt Danny. That word may not mean anything to you but it means everything to Americans.

The U.S. Bureau of Labor and Statistics released their monthly report on unemployment this morning.. and it is still way too high !

This, of course, is to be expected as nothing is being done by anyone, Washington, domestic corporations, anyone, to enact the state-of-emergency action necessary to solve the problem. <img src="http://www.uspoliticsonline.com/images/smilies/eek.gif"/>

As the current figures show, unemployed people are now dropping off the accounting charts!

<a href="http://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.t01.htm">Table T01</a>

<a href="http://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.t08.htm">Table T08</a>

And Table 4
<quote>
Table 4. Persons not in the labor force by age, sex, race, Hispanic or Latino ethnicity, desire for work, prior job search, and availability
for work, June 2011 (Source: Current Population Survey)
(Numbers in thousands) (not available online). This table shows about 60% of the disaffected workers, etc., not considered in labor force but definitely wanting work, the remainder having dropped off the grid. Ask the BLS for this table, they will e-mail it to you.. and ask them why they don't just publish a link to it for all to see! The current 60% number of disaffected workers stands at 6,810,000)
</quote>

So, the BLS "official" unemployment rate: 9.092%.. compared to last period's 9.182%.
The True Unemployment Rate: 15.36%.. compared to last period's 15.71%.

The true unemployment rate is found by adding the disaffected worker count of 11,350,000 (calculating 100% using 6,810,000, the 60% figure as a base) to the labor force in table T01 (153,228,000), then dividing that into the sum of the disaffected worker count and the "officially" unemployed count of 13,931,000 from Table T01.. = 15.36%

The total part time for economic and non-economic reasons count of 26,654,000 in T08 is down from the previous reporting period (27,022,000).

So what does this all mean?

The Civilian Labor Force dropped again, from 153,421,000 to 153,228,000, and the number of officially unemployed dropped from 14,087,000 to 13,931,000.. and so did the number of employed people, dropping from 139,334,000 to 139,296,000.

So where did all our people go? Did they retire, join the military, get thrown in prison? The percentages are down more because the number of counted people is down than because the economy is rebounding (which it isn't).

No, what is logically most likely is that the BLS is no longer counting huge numbers of "discouraged workers", because for many of the past's 99-weekers who have long ago given up, many now homeless, they aren't available and reporting anymore to the BLS as their survey agreement with the BLS requires of them.. and thus the BLS agent's statement that the "discouraged workers" count they have is 60% of the actual is likely not true, as it may be quite a bit less than that.

Thus we simply don't have a true count of the total unemployed.. which is, logically, much higher than the 25,281,000 the BLS presents to us.

The government and the media just aren't presenting to the general public the numbers they have that truly shows that unemployment is way above 9.1%..

.. And the government just doesn't have all the facts necessary to show that unemployment is likely way above the 15.36% figure we can indeed extrapolate from their woefully under-stated unemployment figures.

Nothing is improving here.

Nothing.

The problem is just hidden.

Obama said today that if we extend unemployments even more - I believe is 99 weeks currently - it will create jobs now..

Seriously that's his plan.. Borrow more and spend more...

How about this plan instead take less in income taxes from those who are working, and paying taxes. Cut all income tax rates by 20%, Cut all federal spending by 25%, and halt abusive regulation.

It will hurt washington and the country in the short term but will help in the long term. There is no quick fix to this ness that has taken us many years to create.

I'm in support of substantial unemployment benefits, but they can't go on forever. Unemployment benefits can keep people in a region so they don't have to leave to find work, it keeps folks in their homes a little longer but it doesn't improve the economy.

Heck, open more schools and training programs and give the unemployed loans they don't have to pay back until employed in a field they train in. We'll at least get an economic benefit out of opening and maintaining facilities along with employing instructors.

Things will never change when people like you just want to look at today. Te future is what matters. You want to blame bush and anyone else with a R by thief name but you don't want to fix the future.you want to tax and keep spending at the asinine levels we have seen the last 20 years.

The UNITED STATES IS BROKE, and BANKRUPT. it's a fact...

Spending must be cut and people need tax relief....

Cut tax rates 20% cut all spending 25% remove many deductions, and halt abusive federal regulations...

That is how we get out of the mess...

It will nevr happen, and we will face a collapse...

We just borrowed 2.5 trillion more with no clue how it or te other 14 trillion will be paid back.... We are spending more then We have coming in.. Qn what we have coming in will jot go up unless we confiscate more of the taxpayers money...

The problem is if you take more from bob he has less to pay Suzy and or buy from Larry.

Reagan combined spending and tax cuts to achieve the Keynesian strategy of increasing demand through debt spending.

Alternatively it didn't work as well for Bush or Obama.

So it helps to ask yourself how the government can push the economy so much for so long and see little to no sustainable growth for about a decade.

Blame Bush, blame Obama, I don't care. Personally I blame the fact that the US labor market has not been a good investment for about a decade.

Obama came to office during a massive recession. The economy has been showing signs of weakness for about a decade. Meanwhile partisans who don't understand economics will blame the guy on the other side.

There is a fundamental problem in the economy and it isn't the debt or Obama or Bush but the labor market. The problems there have been significant for about a decade. It is not a new problem that is a result of Obama.

Obama's failure, as well as Bush's, is the failure to fix it. Find a guy that will even talk about it and I would surprised. And I am not talking about BS economic theory.

The labor market is fine aside from the fact that we have a recession. You'll know there's a labor market problem when we have an economic boom and unemployment stays high anyway.

As for this jobs report, good news mostly.

The labor market never really recovered under Bush. It did ok numbers wise because a lot of people were underemployed or in temporary positions.

In the end the growth of that period was mostly an illusion that simply disappeared. Now a lot of the growth is coming from similar attempts to squeeze a financial gain out of investments that offer to real increase in US GDP and in some cases strangle it.

It's true that the Bush years were mostly an illusion, and the employment market wasn't as solid as in the 90s under Clinton. However, the Bush years compare well to other economic booms. And we did see a worldwide boom that lifted a billion people out of poverty. Not because of Bush of course, but because of the spread of better governance and free market principles around the world, as well as expanded trade.

But you'll know a truly stagnant labor market when you see it, and it won't be 5% unemployment. Even accounting for underemployed people and discouraged workers, 5% is close to full employment. What killed the Bush years was the deficit and the fixation on housing as opposed to productive investments.

WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hiring picked up slightly in July and the unemployment rate dipped to 9.1 percent. The modest improvement may quiet fears of another recession a day after Wall Street posted its worst losses in nearly three years.

Employers added 117,000 jobs last month, the Labor Department said Friday. That's better than the past two months, which were also revised higher.

The better-than-expected report gave stocks a small lift one day after the Dow Jones industrial average fell more than 500 points. The Dow jumped as much as 171 points when the market opened, but then erase most gains to rise only 31 points in early-morning trading.

"These numbers are not great," said Ian Shepherdson, an economist at High Frequency Economics, in a note to clients. "But they are a long way from recession territory."

The capital in the US is still failing to find productive investments. A lot of it is simply not being invested or being held to account for the losses in the housing market.

The labor market is a joke in everything but energy which is a result of increases in energy costs which just hurts the employment situation more.

Demand meanwhile is being supported by debt spending and the Federal government giving money to the states. This is going away and the states are going to start contracting their economies.

There are only so many ditch digging jobs out there. Someone has to be able and willing to pay you to do it to make any money at it. There are more people then jobs, that's the problem.
As an example: The firm my wife works for has been flooded by hundreds of replies for 1 job posting, that's hundreds of people all trying to get one job and the overwhelming majority have been completely unqualified.

There's about 1 new job in any given month for every 5 officially unemployed people. It isn't people too stuck up it's an overall in-availability of employment.

There aren't so many jobs period. At the company i work for we currently have 18 open positions. 18 is not a big number in the scope of over 500 current employees now.

That being said...Today is Monday about 1:35 EST - Today alone we have received over 64 resumes/applications for those 18 jobs. And thats just today.

Some overqualified, some under. The fact remains - job creation is definitely slow and there ARE far more workers than employment opportunities!

I agree to a point as any president that added to the debt has some responsibility, but Obama raised the national debt higher and faster than any president before him, 3 trillion in two yrs. Further he is adding another 1.5 trillion this yr and next for a total of 6 trillion in four yrs. This was way more than the straw that broke the camels back.

My signature told the story for a long time, but his legacy may need to be change to "Obama, the president who downgraded the country"

Don't get me wrong, I think he's doing a totally shitty job and I agree with thanatos that he's going to go down in history as one of the worst presidents ever.

But I think there's a distinction between handling the mess one inherited in an inept and embarrasing manner and having been soley responsible for the creation of that mess, which is what I read thanatos' post to be implying.

After the first trillion he spent in office it stopped being an inherited problem. In one year he almost tripled Bush's spending. Fact is this downgrade could have been averted if Obama was not such an arrogant and incompetent leader. Almost three years with no budget. Almost three years of failed spending. almost three years of always blaming the other guy for his mismanagement. Three years of divisive actions by the most left white house ever.

Stop trying to make excuses for your bad choice.

If the economy had collapsed a year earlier than it did President Bush would have spent that trillion dollars in his last year in office. $700 billion of it was approved by Congress before President Bush even left office.

Why engage in such political hackery when you know it to be false? It only harms your own country.

Bush policies: $5.07 trillion added to debt
Obama policies: $1.44 trillion added to debt

Taking the oath of office doesn't make him responsible for the train wreck that was in progress. You may want it to and you may even convince feeble minded people that it does but it's still untrue.

I'm so proud of you, Danny. You're finally admitting that Obama's policies have added to the debt crisis.

It's almost like you're ready to come back to the real world.

We'll know you're ready when you assign Obama some responsibility for the continuing wars (you know he expanded Afghanistan and started a whole new one in Libya, right?) and also for continuing the tax cuts. Of course, your little graph there assigns those spending items to Bush (which is very dishonest).

It will hurt washington and the country in the short term but will help in the long term. There is no quick fix to this ness that has taken us many years to create.

</quote>

Cutting taxes won't help put folks back to work. That toos fall under Keynes. The Cons like this part of Keynes but not the deficet spending part.

Truth is, if you can handle it, is our economic model has created the unemployment, which a couple of bubbles hid for a spell. We will have a lost generation of unemployed folks, thanks to corporate globalization, that replaced decent paying jobs with benefits, including insurance, with low paying dead end service sector jobs. And everyone acts surprised? Give me a fucking break.

I am afraid that the Cons idea of what is good for business is good for America is a damn lie. Idiots. This ideology helped create the offshoring of jobs, the very same jobs that built up America's middle class post WW2. Hell, you cannot change the economic model so drastically and expect no negetive results for the average folks.

Trickle down economics will destroy the working folks, which make up the majority of America. This shit ain't rocket science. And offshoring to cheap communist labor is part of this trickle down deal, IMO. Enrich the elites and more crumbs will fall to the rabble on the floor. CONSERVATISM.

I just wonder how much of the deficet and debt is due to the growth of social safety nets that the offshoring and financial deal caused? Don't we normally see a growth in debt during recessions with high long termed unemployment as we have now? Or do you guys just shut your eyes, cover your ears, and then blame Obama for everything? Sure as hell looks that way to me.

Of course the Cons way would be to get rid of all safety nets, continue to allow the loss of jobs, and say fuck em to the displaced workers. And then blame the plight of the unemployed on the unemployed, as being lazy or something similiar. So easy to despise these Cons, especially the ones who are working people and ignorant, proved by the fact they continue to vote these Cons back in.

I am voting for all Cons this next cycle. I think they need to finish destroying average America so we can correct it, and start on a new path, away from this stupidity.

No, for his work with the NAFTA, the APEC, the GATT, the WTO, and China.

Also, by signing the Commodity Futures Modernization, the Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act, and tinkering with the CRA.

The first led to the floodgates opening on the off-shoring of American manufacturing jobs and the latter was instrumental to the sub-prime mortgage meltdown and the global financial crisis.

You are damn right, I get sick and tired of hearing the Democraps claim Clinton balanced the budget. I followed it, Clinton fought a balanced budget tooth and nail, even shut down the Government fighting it. When he finally realized the American people were for a balanced budget he introduced the exact same bill he had vetoed when the Republicans passed it so he could claim credit.

William Jefferson Clinton was and still is a scumbag, slimball, piece of human fecal matter!

Oregon Democrat officially resigns from House

<post author="wooyarn" datetime="2011-04-08T00:00:00" id="p1">
Oregon Democrat David Wu officially resigned from Congress late Wednesday night in the wake of accusations of unwanted sexual advances toward a fundraiser's daughter.

IMO people like this should not be given the option of resigning, they should be fired by the other Congress-critters.

He also will receive as much as 900K tax paid retirement. That should not be allowed.

I disagree.

He didn't break the law.

What he did was unseemly and, in my opinion more than a little bit sleezy, but it wasn't a crime and it didn't cause any real harm to his office, his constituents, Congress, or America.

If he broke the law or if he did real harm I'd agree with you.

But stepping down to avoid the American public's juvenile obsession with "scandal" isn't cause to revoke the compensations he's earned over a career.

Really nothing to defend.

In so far as I'm able to ascertain there have been no criminal charges filed against Wu up to this point and there is no indication that he's the subject of any law enforcement investigation.

If there is an investigation and it does result in charges being filed and he is found guilty of breaking the law I'll amend my opinion on the matter accordingly.

Until then all we've got to go on is that an 18-year-old woman made vague charges about "unwanted sexual advances".

I'm just not willing to run out and grab a rope on the strength of that.

Like I said, he's sleezy. No question about that. I have no interest in hanging out with the guy.

But he's never actually been charged with a crime.

If saying thhat he can't be punished as though he's a commited a crime because he's never even been charged with a crime, let alone convicted of commiting a crime, is defending him then, <img src="http://www.uspoliticsonline.com/images/smilies/rolleyes.gif"/>

Since women NEVER lie about "unwanted" sexual contact, ESPECIALLY not when it involves a prominent public figure, we probably should just take the girl's word for it and throw the judicial process to the wind.

Let's not.

In fact, lets not be hystrionic knee-jerk little crybabies in any respect.

Let's let that young adult bring formal charges against the guy if she feels he actually commited a crime and allow our criminal justice system to determine whether or not her chargees have merit, whether or not Wu is guilty of those charges, and, if guilty, what his punishment should be.

Crazy fucking suggestion, I know.

<quote>
A FoxNews.com Twitter account was hacked briefly on Monday and six false tweets, saying that US President Barack Obama had been shot dead, were sent.

In a statement posted on its website later on Monday morning, Fox News called the tweets "malicious" and "false".

The media outlet, owned by Rupert Murdoch's News Corp, said it was investigating the hacking and had alerted the US Secret Service.

That's the thing, it seems that hackers have a bit of a leg up on law enforcement, with far more of them getting away with the crime than getting caught. Sure, you'll see headlines about hackers getting busted here and there, but they're such a tiny portion of the folks doing these things that it doesn't make much difference. It's just for show.

Heck, Lulzsec formed, attacked a bunch of sites for a few months, then got bored and disbanded. Doesn't exactly put confidence in law enforcement's ability to fight these guys.

Yeah and that's where they're gonna get stung, not to mention the time and resources of the USSS and Court costs they'll have to cover plus the fine and loss of services in VOS of whomever is their service provider.

I'd imagine the reason most hackers never get caught is that there are a lot of them and they mostly just cause some irritation so there's not that much of a force pursuing them.

Well, the charges could potentially carry 25 years in prison just at the Federal level alone, so most of them tend not to do it within the US, and that's not inclusive of any mail/wire fraud or state charges etc. Likely they wouldnt get stung with the lot, but i'm pretty sure we'll see an example made out of whoever was responsible for this.

If, and its a big if, the hacker[s] can be identified and are within US jurisdiction they could be facing very serious federal charges. I would bet they would try to make a case of conspiracy.

But don't hold your breath on them being identified.

I don't know why McCotter is running. His chance of actually gaining the nomination is less than zero. Is he doing a Gephardt aka 1988, ie hoping that a reasonable run will set him up in the House leadership; or is he hoping to increase his name recognition and fundraising, and then switch to challenge Stabenow?
</post>
<post author="adaher" datetime="2011-03-07T00:00:00" id="p5">
Well, a Presidential run increases name recognition no matter what, and it increases prestige if he does even a little better than expected. But I think his motivation for running is that there aren't any other candidates quite like him. And he will gain some following if he can get his message out. There is definitely a niche in the Republican electorate for his brand of populism.

If I had to predict, I'd say he actually wins a few delegates, becomes more well known, and yes, runs for Senate. But not against Stabenow. I suspect Levin won't run for reelection and McCotter will go for that vacant seat in 2014.

Union workers have often been more supportive of Democrats, but working people overall tend to go pretty overwhelmingly for Republicans. And private sector union workers have been the classic Reagan Democrats at times. They are very winnable for Republicans. Anyone who pays taxes is a potential win for the Republicans.

Not until they get out of the pocket of the extreme religious right. There are many people who agree with some republican ideologies about economics, but are wholly unwilling to sacrifice their moral principles to vote for republican social repression. I think they'd be surprised at how many votes they could gain by going back to the true conservative value of less government interference in people's private lives.

America didn't fill up with people from other countries so that we could mimic them. taxes aren't a relative thing. You either have enough money, or you don't, and when taxes take up a pretty sizeable chunk of your income, it's no consolation that the French have it worse.

To my way of thinking, the new credit regulations affecting small local banks ARE a huge part of today's economic problems. These were an over-reaction to the credit bubble (sponsored by big bank deregulation) that caused the crash. The borrowers were blamed and are now being punished. Try to get a mortgage or personal or business loan- it shouldn't be this damn hard.

YarrrRRRRRR!!!!!

ahoy me buckos!

though i thought Ryancare was a disaster fer those 'o us who be under 55, i did enjoy the idear that pressure was finally bein' bought to bear to begin a serious dialogue on how to reduce spendin' on our eldest.

one way or another, spendin' on the big three 'o entitlement healthcare plans have to be addressed...and fer that, congressman Ryan deserves credit fer puttin' a plan forward that, by hook or by crook, was goin' to cut the benefits old folks receive.

i thought 'twas gutless that them who be o'er 55 would be untouched, fer it seemed like typical washington to hand out slices 'o pie now (in this case, tax cuts fer the wealthiest americans) and deal with the hurt far, far down the road.

still...'twas a move in the right direction, fer if nothin' else, it pushed this urgent debate forward, aye....until now...

<quote>
House Republicans signaled on Thursday that they were backing away for now from the centerpiece of their budget plan — a proposal to overhaul Medicare — underscoring the political risks of addressing the nation’s long-term fiscal problems.

Republican leaders insisted that they remained committed to the Medicare proposal, put forward by Representative Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, which has drawn intense attacks from Democrats and liberal groups in recent weeks. But they chose not to proceed with legislation this year, effectively putting the issue off until after the next election.

*hawks out a ball 'o phlegm and spits it on the deck*

rawr!

let it not be said that them House conservatives give a damn 'bout the nation's balloonin' debt, fer instead 'o just puttin' the pain somewhar down the road, they've now tabled the entire debate on the most urgent part 'o our government spendin', due to a yellow bellied fear 'o gettin' keelhauled at the polls. house conservatives, apparently, prefer to dick around with nickel 'n dime budget items like planned parenthood and NPR.

'tis just more 'o the same, aye? the more pressin' matter 'o " how do we get elected ?" reigns supreme amongst the concerns 'o our folks in washington.

I know and Obamacare is so well liked, there are only 30 states taking Obamacare to the Supreme Court to kill it.

But to budget cutting, if the Pub's run to the sideline on cutting spending, then I will be one mad SOB. This spending is insane, we know the Dem's won't touch anything that requires a cut in spending. So if the Pubs fail in cutting, then we're fucked. Simple as that. You liberals and all your entitlements will drag this country into the fires of hell, not even our great great grandkids will be able to bail us out for all our greedy entitlements that they would not ever see and yet would have to pay for our greed.

The progressive caucus proposal cuts $5.8 trillion over 10 years by cutting over $1 trillion of the bloated defense budget and significantly cutting corporate subsidies.

Thus far the Ryan proposal is the only one that actually adds to the deficit since his tax cuts are not paid for.

The progressive plan cuts the deficit, but it does not cut spending. and all those numbers are imaginary at this point, because the CBO hasn't scored the progressive caucus proposals. It is very possible, even likely, that their plan raises much less revenue than they think.

And they don't cut corporate subsidies. Let's be clear on that. They cut tax breaks. Corporate subsidies continue to failing companies. It's only profitable companies that "progressives" want to take money from. failing companies get to be on welfare.

Actually,it sure looked like some pretty massive spending cuts to me. Perhaps you mean that it doesn't beat up enough on old people and children?

Corporate subsidies appear to be more directed to already highly profitable companies, not to failing companies.

The whole point is that with this plan there is moderate pain for everyone, and because of that, it passes the fairness test.

Defense spending cuts, but increases to other programs. Almost all of the deficit reduction comes from raising revenues to unprecedented heights. The CBO was unlikely to agree with their projections, thus they never submitted it for scoring. which means the plan was a fraud.

i thought 'twas gutless that them who be o'er 55 would be untouched, fer it seemed like typical washington to hand out slices 'o pie now (in this case, tax cuts fer the wealthiest americans) and deal with the hurt far, far down the road.

still...'twas a move in the right direction, fer if nothin' else, it pushed this urgent debate forward, aye....until now...

The Ryan budget was never anything more than a political tactic designed to soothe the Baggies and put cutting Medicare on the agenda. As a plan for federal taxing and spending it was as phony and unworkable as that silly thing Boehner and his pals unveiled at a Virginia lumber yard before the off-year elections. Remember that one? I'll bet you don't.

Medicare has its problems. Uncle Sam spends about $300,000 bucks on each Medicare beneficiary before s/he climbs the Golden Stair. But said beneficiary averages only $150,000, in payments into the kitty before starting to collect. The other $150,000 comes from general revenue and is too big a bite for our currently broke and mis-managed government with an aging population base.

There are a number of approaches to solving this payment/benefit gap. The Ryan plan simply slides the missing $150,000 onto the old folks by opening an every-widening gap between what Uncle Sam will pay and what the for-profit insurance companies will charge. This is a political non-starter.

There is a typical example of the Law of Unintended Consequences in Ryan's clever bait-and-switch. When voters at last figure out just what medicine the Republican Party is prescribing, the reaction is, "Holy sh!t! No way! Let me see that single payer plan again."

ahoy John Drake,

oh, ye shall get no arguement from me, matey.

Ryancare, to me, was simply a transfer 'o wealth...claiming to balance the budget, while it actually attacked programs that benefitted the elderly, the poor and children, whilst also dolin' out a huge tax break to 1% 'o the nation.

still, it moved the dialogue forward, fer at long last it gave substance to what conservatives hath been darkly hintin' at fer some time;

to privatize medicare.

fer his candor, aye, i credit congressman Ryan. yet fer all this, the GOP hath now shown that they be swathed in cowardice and were unable to sustain thar debate in the turmoil that dogged thar every step in townhall meetings.

aye.

The handfull of Republicans foolish enough to be talking about cutting Medicare ae getting their tail feathers singed by constituents at town halls all over the country.

This is the same reaction that the Decider got when he decided to spend his political capital trying to privatize Social Security. Every time the GOP sticks its rhetorical fork in the entitlements light bulb socket the result is pretty much the same. Sooner or later the brighter ones will figure it out.

Yeah, REPUBLICANS are. Just as REPUBLICANS are getting in trouble for cutting union pay and bargaining rights. But Democrats aren't. Democrats also aren't getting in trouble for cutting Medicare. So we'll let them do it. The President has a plan to cut Medicare, Republicans will pass his plan.

RyanCare and the Bush Social Security fiasco are the last ditch efforts of the GOP to repeal Social Security and Medicare. They realize the window is closing, the Baby Boomers, the biggest voting bloc, is going to be overwhelmingly for Medicare and Social Security, by virtue of their age, and there will be no chance of repeal going forward.
Which means rolling back the tax cuts, maybe even some of the Reagan tax cuts.

Which is why Ryan blubbered on about the need to do something NOW, to address the problem NOW, and then proposed RyanCare, which doesn't even begin to do anything to reduce spending for 10 years.

And of course he slipped in some rather large tax cuts for the wealthiest people in America.

There just aren't enough morons in the country for that bill to ever have had a chance.

That's one interpretation. The other is that Medicare and Social Security in their current forms cannot deliver promised benefits to Boomers. And no, they don't get to wait until they stop working to hike up taxes on the rest of us. They benefitted disproportionately from the tax cuts, so they will reap what they've sown when they retire, which is underfunded retirement programs.

I can assure you, Gen-X were not the primary beneficiaries of the Bush tax cuts. Boomers were.

the reason state budgets across our mighty and christian land didn't implode in 2010 was in part due to the stimulus...though ye could say that thar be pain and trouble felt from sea to shinin' sea now that the stimulus hath run out.

at any rate, Ryancare be restin' at the bottem 'o the sea since medicare reform was the centerpiece 'o the plan. that means that the House members in the GOP haven't submitted a budget either, and haven't done so fer the same reasons the Democrats held thar powder on the same issue:

Ryancare was passed by the house. It has not gone anywhere.

As for your stimulus bailing out the states and the unions etc, it was a failure. Quote: "though ye could say that their be pain and trouble felt from sea to shinin' sea now that the stimulus hath run out." All the stimulus did was kick the can down the road and left behind a trillion in national debt. And you left one thing out, the pain that it's going to take to pay that debt back. Obama has added 4.5 trillion to the national debt in three yrs and when he is out of office at the end of this term he will have added 6 trillion. Now think about the pain our great great grandkids will endure in paying that money back.

Of course you liberals don't care about that, as long as you can keep sucking on the tits of government to keep your greedy entitlements. Fuck the great great grandkids. I'm taking mine, fuck them

We're starting to see some unforced Republican errors now. They voted for Ryancare without fully understanding what it was, now many are walking back their votes. Total confusion now in the caucus.

Here's what they need to do, and they need to do it now, although I'm sure they won't: endorse the President's Medicare plan. He just threw it out there to show seriousness, He doesn't intend to actually pass it. Call his bluff. Pass his plan and force HIM to backtrack by vetoing. Better yet, maybe he'll sign it and Medicare gets cut.

ahoy Adaher,

respectfully matey, i have to disagree.

the GOP hath backed off thar claim to Ryancare and they've done so because they specifically do not want the centerpiece 'o thar debt reduction plan, the privatization 'o medicare, to be an election issue...

...which be ironic. the GOP won the House last year on thar claims on makin' debt &amp; deficit reduction thar priority, and now they do not wish to discuss the topic further.

aye?

They definitely haven't given up on deficit reduction, they just know they need to find common ground with Democrats and the President. Right now, that means cutting farm subsidies and possibly oil and coal subsidies as well. It also means corporate tax reform, which would probably raise some revenues even if that's not the intent. They are smart enough to realize that right now is not the time for confrontation with the President, especially since he's willing to make some offers.

You liberals need a government tit to suck on and the more tits you have to suck on the fatter you get. You liberals are already so fat you can hardly move. Meaning you liberals are sucking so hard you had to borrow 14+ trillion to feed your blubber over and above what the tax payer was providing.

Obama did with his expansion of government and his failed stimulus and his overspending to the tune of 1.5 trillion of borrowed money. By the end of his first and only term he will have added 6 trillion to the national debt to feed you greedy liberals blubber.

Goob said Obama needs to excessively spend and borrow to feed you greedy liberals. To try and bring down the unemployment, he based that on an already failed stimulus. And he could care less about the debt, Christ Obama is already adding 1.5 trillion a yr to our debt and now Goob wants to add, at lest 2.5 trillion a yr. You liberals appetite for government tits to suck on is way out of control.

Yeah that should reduce Obama's deficit from 1.6 trillion a yr to 1.58 trillion. So Obama is on his path of adding to the national debt 6 trillion by the end of his only term.

Common ground with Democrats is cutting nothing. Liberals bitched when the pubs wanted to cut NPR. I noticed you did not mention cutting green subsidies, did you know for every green the government gives a 30% tax credit. Yeah, if you owe 30K in taxes and you installed a 100K solar system you now don't have to pay the 30k in taxes. And worse yet Solar and those windmillis is not cutting one drop of oil we use.

There'll be more cuts than just what the Democrats want. The Republicans control the HOuse. Not a dime gets spent without their consent. But a wholesale campaign to restructure the way the government spends money is not going to happen until 2013, and that can only happen if Republicans get unified control of the government. In the meantime, solid first steps can and should be taken.

Cutting a few subsidies is not a solid first step. Like I said the Dem's bitched at cutting funding for NPR, there is no way the Dem's want to come together at all with the Pub's. I agree it will take 2013 to make the real changes necessary to bring this spending under control. And that will take the American people to stand up and say "cut spending" with their vote.

Democrats are willing to cut farm subsidies, and that is real money. Merely keeping spending from growing fast also pays big given that economic growth adds hundreds of billions to GDP every year. Some people think the Republicans got rolled on the CR compromise, but they still ended up saving $70 billion compared to what the President wanted to spend. Lower baselines continue to save money in the future, which makes the spending cuts in 2010 alone worth $600 billion over 10 years. Chances are, we'll get $100 billion less in 2011, maybe $150 billion if we play our cards right. That makes balancing the budget easier in future years.

I think that is getting lost in this debate. While they argue over 60 or 65 billion in cuts, the real cost will still be 1.3 trillion in authorized spending through septemeber, of which every penny will be borrowed. We have already spent an entire years revenue.

ahoy Jviehe,

if that 1.3 trillion bothers ye, then all ye must do be to find a way to take the freedom and liberty to vote away from folks from the baby boomers on up.

that way ye could dash social security, medicaid and medicare to pieces.

otherwise, ye must work with the limitations that ye have.

You know, it just does not seem that hard to get the fiscal house back in order. Since much of the problem lies in SS, Medicare, and Medicaid, adjusting the retirment age, with means testing ought to fix it. Am I wrong?

And of course IF, we stop allowing decent jobs being offshored, more folks would pay more in taxes, and even SS and the rest. No, this just does not seem such an unsolvable problem to me, yet those jackwags won't touch it!

I think a guy with good math skills and a 5th grade education could solve it, without impoverishing folks. Assuming we still have a middle class tax base here 30 years from now. And assuming we stop coddling the rich, and tax em more on those capital gains they reap from foreign investments. A one time tax on wealth of the rich should be considered, as we have to ask ALL folks capable of helping, to help and to feel the pain a bit. So, the problem can indeed be solved, if the lobbiests would take a 4 year vacation, or Congress would take a vacation from the lobbiests.

It's really strange. For 20 years Watchdog groups, Congressman, and the everyday Joe have told Congress of the problem with folks retiring now. Year after year Congress ignored it. They even borrowed against SS. Everyone has complained about offshoring, and outsourcing, and the damage it does to our economy. But that neither is ever addressed. We debate about a few million to planned parenthood and gays in the military. <img src="http://www.uspoliticsonline.com/images/smilies/mad.gif"/>

The budget itself is 3.7 TRILLION meaning with that we will be in arrears this year alone to the tune of 1.7 TRILLION dollars.

And democrats are fighting over 61 billion in cuts--or less than 2% of the 3.7 trillion dollar budget.

This is actually getting funny.

End the war! No, keep the war!

Drawdown! No, surge!

Close GITMO! No, keep GITMO!

End military tribunals!!! No, let's go back to military tribunals!!!

Has President Obama actually kept one single GWOT-related campaign promise?

I didn't think it was possible but America has actually become more aggressive, and more expansive of military footprint, under President Obama.

I can pretty much guarantee at this point that within the next 12 calendar months waterboarding and secret rendition will both be back on the table - if they're actually really off the table right now (which I think is exceptionally unlikely given the Obama administration's warmongering).

Just a continuation of the Obama social experiment presidency. Just do things no matter how much the public opposes it and see if there is any actual political fallout. These people know that Americans have the attention span of a two year old, so they pass shit knowing in two months eveyone will be looking at Charlie Sheen or Lady GaGa's latest escapade. That way they get the wishes of a small group of far leftist taken care of. Too bad that got jerked away in Nov of last year, they were on a roll, weren't they? On the gun stuff, they have obviously have been counseled that fucking with the 2nd amendment (again) would not be something the public will dismiss or forget before election 2012. So hey, lets try this..........lets bring some terrorists into the same city where 3000 people lowere slaughtered on Sept 11th and give them a real nice, long, outrageously expensive, "fair" trial. Let's show the world, and most importantly the muslim world how fair and considerate we are with terrorists and not worry about how the residents of NYC feel about it. If that isn't a social experiment, I don't know what is.

Obama and his motherfuckers need to go.

He can't do it himself, we all know that, but between him and the boss, they could have had Nancy and Harry push it thru no problem (prior to Nov 2010). I am sure the reason they held back knew that the political price to be paid would be too high.
He has also sabre rattled his ass off on having the feds go after CA's pot industry, which we have yet to see materialize. Now he basically sez Congress is not as smart/qualified as he is in dealing with Gitmo terror suspects and their trials. Holder is sure a NYC trial in public court is the way to go, so tell me, Eric or Congress or the people of NYC, who's the dumbass of that trio?

I don't know why some bring up broken promises. WHO has not done so? It used to be a joke, but if the politician involved is one you hate, it's like this is unusual again. It isn't. If their lips are moving during the campaign, they tell some what they want to hear. And that is politics.

I am more concerned about Holder going after the pot myself. If you are gonna avoid the trial on US soil, just because you fear the terrorists, it shows a yellow streak, and radical Islam would see it as weakness.

Not exactly, I don't believe this will be seen as anything but a loss for terrorists who have ready allies in the left. Obama/Holder never should have attempted this in the first place. It was a bad decision and Holder's refusal to acknowledge that indicates he is one of the ready made allies.

This is part of the administration plan to use Congress as political cover for reneging on the promise to "close Gitmo." It's quite ingenious actually.

Q: How do you tell when a politician is lying?

A: His lips are moving.

This is nothing new. Bush 43 did it, Clinton did it, Bush 41 did it, Reagan did it.

If anything Obama is your typical, run-of-the-mill President, no more or less honest than any of his predecessors.

Door painting

<post author="Sweet Sadi..." datetime="2012-04-04T14:29:00" id="p1">
While I'm waiting for Roto Rooter to get here (been waiting since 10 am actually) I decided to finish painting my front door. I started painting it a few months ago but then it got cold and then I didn't have time. I have a question. The little glass arch window on the top has yellowed. I want to paint it white and there are screws on the inside of it (pics to follow). Has anyone delt with painting this? It's a hard plastic. I'm not sure if I unscrew it if the whole window is going to pop out then I'd have to re-culk it.
The Door almost done painting/drying:

The arch on the outside (sooo ugly and dirty):

The inside (where the screws are):

I'd like to just take the plastic off and spray paint it.

<post author="judy201" datetime="2012-04-04T15:07:00" id="p2">
I have several doors like these and my painter never even considered not painting the screws. These screws are there to stay and no reason it should ever be removed (except if glass will get cracked one day). How ever if you really don't want these screws to get painted you can remove one screw at a time and paint that spot, then place back the screw and remove the next screw and paint that spot. You can repeat this to all screws like this you wont get the window to be loose either. But why bother? Just paint it quickly before Roto Rooter will arrive!!! By the way, that window should always be painted because if not it will turn yellow ( like yours) I don't know why people don't paint it.
Good luck

Oh I don't care if the screws are painted I just wanted to know if I took the screws out if the whole window would come out. I'd love to just get the plastic parts off and give them a quick spray paint. My husband said just tape everything off and get the ol' paint brush out and do it the old fashioned way. I'm just lazy!

<post author="hippie4yah..." datetime="2012-04-04T17:35:00" id="p4">
I have the same front door! And I learned the hard way that when the screws are removed the window will most definitely fall out. (luckily its not too expensive to replace!) but the window itself is glued like woah to the outside plastic piece so you'll still need to tape it. Definitely wait until you have a second set of hands to remove it!
</post>
<post author="judy201" datetime="2012-04-05T13:00:00" id="p5">
Yes it might fall out very easy! My advice is to cover around and around with masking tape that comes off easy and then paint it. By the way I would use regular paint not spray paint

Please vote on hardwood floors!
</headline>
<post author="lolonyo" datetime="2012-04-04T13:24:00" id="p1">
We had some water damage in our kitchen in November and replaced our laminate flooring throughout the main floor with new laminate. We HATE the new stuff! LOL Thankfully the store has an awesome guarantee and because we're not happy with it we can replace it for free (just have to pay the difference if we choose a more expensive product).
So, we're upgrading to hardwood. One of the things we don't like about the laminate is that the pattern is so repetitive and obvious, so that's what we are wanting to avoid with the real stuff.
Some info that may be useful: we have a 40-ish pound Golden retriever. She is getting older and settling down a bit but still gets excited and will likely scratch the hell out of whatever we choose! We also have a 2.5 year old crazy little boy and a baby girl due in 25 days!!
Option 1: Birch (on the left). Much softer wood, will show a lot of wear. This is the safer option because the color is going to be quite consistent throughout.
Option 2: An exotic Acacia (on the right). Much harder than the birch, but riskier because of the color variation.
<img src="http://i39.tinypic.com/241v0c7.jpg"/>

Most of our decor is pretty traditional but minimal. We don't have a lot of clutter just basic pieces with clean lines.
Here are a few pics of the acacia installed in a home that the sales rep sent me to give an idea of what it could look like in a larger application.

<img src="http://i40.tinypic.com/21jn281.jpg"/>

<img src="http://i41.tinypic.com/2q2inop.jpg"/>

So what would you choose?

Which hardwood?

Option 1 - Birch (32.3%)

I am really not a fan of the color variation in the Acacia. Way too busy for me. By default, I'd choose the Birch.
When we move into our new home, we're getting Brazillian Teak which is a very hard wood. It has light to dark color variations but not quite so busy.

I can't remember were you the one with the splatted maple? Can you post pics of the laminate you hate and why in a follow up post? Stuff like that can be really helpful to others who are looking to replace their flooring.
Since you're redoing it anyway can I ask a few more questions? Is this a floor you'll ever be refinishing later to fix the scratches and dents?

<post author="mardoll10" datetime="2012-04-04T15:47:00" id="p6">
I voted for the Acacia because it is my personal preference, but I know that it's not really the most "neutral" choice. Are you planning to stay in the home for a while? Or is there any chance you might sell in the next couple years? If this isn't your "forever home", I would probably pick the more neutral option. Did they have anything else that was similar in color to the birch, but a harder wood? What about getting something basic like oak and staining it to a medium color that is closer to the two you showed?

Yay..all of my Craigslist patience pays off!

<post author="Bluesmooth..." datetime="2012-04-04T12:31:00" id="p1">
So I've been wanting the Ikea Ektorp loveseat in white since we moved into our house. I want a little sofa for the sunroom for drinking coffee and reading the Sunday paper. It's a great value at $379. The only problem is we live 1.5 hours away from the nearest Ikea and shipping it isn't worth the extra money. So, I've been hunting around town for a white love-seat. No luck. For the past year I've been searching on Craiglist only to find stuff like this.
<img src="http://images.craigslist.org/5Ga5F45He3Gd3Kc3Lcc3j89aa2d27c5581597.jpg"/>
So, I gave up on my search on CL for a few months. Then Monday on a whim I looked on CL again and was about to close it down when "Ektorp" caught my eye. Sure enough there was a post for a practically new white Ektorp loveseat for 2/3 of the price. WHOOPEE!!! I just picked it up. This cute little med student bought it last year, but is moving and can't take it with her. It looks brand new. I'M SO EXCITED, I just had to share. I can't wait to buy some fun pillows for it this weekend. I am really thrilled w/ the quality of it. For the price it's really heavy and looks well-made.

Not sure if it will work for you but we maintain 'nap time' with alone quiet time. Ge can sing, he can read a book but he has to stay in bed until I come in. He hates time outs so a warning is all that was required and now he loves that time. We are consistent / same time every day.

I hear you. I pretty much have a non napper. Her best naps are in the car (so helpful..not). I don't get anything done at home as a result. I get 30 minutes in the morning and 45 in the afternoon..lol.
She does go to bed by 7 so you'd think I'd have some time. But with farm, dinner, shower and laundry...that's all there is. :)
No real point...but I feel you.
I also like the quiet time idea. My SIL does this with her 3 year old twins for her sanity. It was rough at first to get used to but now they enjoy it.

<post author="BunnyMende..." datetime="2012-04-04T11:56:00" id="p6">
The quiet time is a good idea, but even if I give her an hour after she wakes up I'm still only getting 12.5 hours of work per week. I need about 20.
I guess I'm thinking I might need a more long-term solution. Maybe even just 2 half days per week dedicated only to working.
I just had it so good for so long with them napping 3-4hrs per day and only working like 15 hrs/wk. ;(

Plantation Shutters. Is this weird?
</headline>
<post author="pombride" datetime="2012-04-04T08:47:00" id="p1">
I want to have PS's installed after we move to our new contruction house. But I only want them on three sides of the house. The back of the house will overlook the pool, so I want that more open with different treatments. I'm not sure if that is odd or not?

<post author="SSM&amp;JLM" datetime="2012-04-04T08:49:00" id="p2">
Not odd to me. We back up to a creek, so on the main floor I don't have anything on the back windows.

Makes sense to me. When we had a woody lot, we only had blinds on the bedrooms.

Btw, have you priced out shutters? It was $700 per window when I got a quote last year.

I know it's a gross amount of money....the house isn't yet completed, so I haven't measured or anything, to get a quote. I do have a couple of places to call but wanted to make sure I wasn't nuts not to do the back (which is mostly windows). I have 4 windows that would need them.

We actually did our whole house and I love it. Our neighbors did only the back of their house, which looks fine on the 1st floor since those rooms only have windows on the back wall, but in my opinion their master bedroom looks a little strange. They have plantation shutters on the long triple window overlooking their back yard, but standard blinds on the two windows that flank their bed. Looks weird from both inside and outside, IMO.
I think what you're describing sounds fine.

<post author="beachbum19..." datetime="2012-04-04T18:21:00" id="p8">
what kind of other window treatments are you thinking? i also wanted to do ps in our kitchen window and bumpout/sunroom but when i got a quote last year it was 4 gs. yikes! i couldn't bring myself to spend that on window treatments. i might just do our kitchen window though. just wondering what you are thinking of doing. i just have curtains up now, which works but i really love shutters. might just have to bite the bullet eventually.

<post author="pombride" datetime="2012-04-04T19:05:00" id="p9">
@ beachbum... The back of the house has double french doors out to the patio and then 3 massive windows in the master that will all look out on our pool and the waterfall. So I kind of want to preserve that view. This is what I am thinking for the bedroom:

<post author="kcpokergal" datetime="2012-04-05T09:18:00" id="p10">
I think it would matter mostly that any particular room had the same window treatment.
I LOVE my plantation shutters. The previous owner put them up. They are actually really nice in the master because they block out light so well.

<post author="GildedIcon" datetime="2012-04-05T20:32:00" id="p11">
We have PS in one room only in our house, it is a room that faces the back. As long as the treatment is the same per room you are good. We had 5 windows done 2 years ago and it was $850 per window.

AW: New vinyl wood plank flooring PIP
</headline>
<post author="Mrs.Christ..." datetime="2012-04-03T23:45:00" id="p1">
My home makeover has really been dragging along and I needed some gratification to keep me motivated. So I decided to go ahead and start laying the vinyl wood plank flooring that's been sitting in my dining room for over a month now.

It is super inexpensive stuff from lumber liquidators and I could not be happier. Installation was easy, only requiring a tape measure, straight edge, marker and regular scissors. I wish the color was a teeny bit lighter, but overall it has the rustic look I wanted. I installed over our existing wood laminate which was in good shape, I just didn't care for the color and style. I think this vinyl wood plank looks just as good as laminate and many of the engineered I've seen. Here's the before:

And now(should look a million times bettern once the baseboards and board &amp; batten are up)

Ours doesn't feel rubbery at all, and feels more like wood. It's not super cold like our laminate was, so that is really nice. Plus it's much much quieter, not nearly as loud as a lot of laminates I have experienced.

Looks great. We've been thinking about it for our upstairs bathrooms. The vinyl in there is horrible looking. I'd also love to cover up the laminate on our main floor but I don't think that's in the budget this year.

My mom was just diagnosed with breast cancer. I'm accompanying her to the surgeon tomorrow. I think my family (me too) are in shock as we really thought pathology would come back negative. She's always been young, healthy, active and there's no family history. Not all guarantees. We just don't exactly where she stands in her diagnosis yet. Prayers for the best news possible and my mom staying positive once this all sinks in are really, really appreciated. Thanks in advance for letting me share. :(

My heart sinks every time I hear of someone else getting diagnosed. I was diagnosed at age 45 sixteen months ago. It has been a long journey but I feel great now! I am training for a half marathon right now. Take it one step at a time. I am saying prayers for your mom (now my BC sister!) and hoping it was caught early and can be treated immediately. I have been blogging my journey. Here's the link if it helps. Hugs!

For those of you reading this....over 80% of women that get diagnosed with breast cancer have NO family history. One in eight women WILL get breast cancer. Mammograms give false security....I had a mammo a few months before I found my lump and my lump was a SLOW growing tumor so it was there when I had the mammo but it was not seen. DO YOUR MONTHLY SELF BREAST EXAMS! If you have dense breasts, push for ultrasounds. ANYONE can get this. I was healthy - aerobics instructor, ate well, did not smoke and NO family history and I got it. I am no different than all of you. I never thought I would get this..... (OK I am putting my soapbox away now...)

New bedding PIP
</headline>
<post author="juno" datetime="2012-04-03T19:15:00" id="p1">
I got my new bedding today:
<img src="http://i42.tinypic.com/o314p.jpg"/>
Photographing this room is impossible! In person the bedding is less washed out, more like the shams appear here.
I like the bedding (and definitely like the quality, which is excellect), but it's not coming together for me. I tried a pattern to liven it up a little over the plain cream spread I had before. Maybe because it's too light against the really dark rug? Or maybe because the walls are the same color? I tried some brown and green throw pillows on the bed, but it was just too much dark, solid color on the light bed, so I think I need some light patterned throw pillows, but I'm not sure. I also think we need something above the bed, but we're in earthquake territory, so I can't think of anything that would work outside of decals, which I don't really like. I still haven't tackled the solid, boring curtains yet like you guys suggested several months ago, but my seamstress mom might be able to help me this summer when she visits.
Whatever we do with the rest of it, I'm so happy that we finally have a down comforter big enough for both of us and down pillows. I think I'm in for some amazing sleep tonight! <img src="http://community.thenest.com/cs/emoticons/emotion-56.gif" alt="Sleep"/>

(I know this thread is about the bedding, but can I just say how much I love your bed? That's exactly what I'm looking for! Love it.)
On the bedding, personally I really like it. I actually think that the lighter color plays nicely against the rug. I think you hit the nail on the head about the curtains...adding a darker color there would contrast nicely against the creamy bedding and walls. And maybe add a few darker colored accent pillows on the bed?
ETA: Just read what you said about the dark throw pillows...maybe try adding pillows with a texture instead?
</post>
<post author="finally:)" datetime="2012-04-03T20:37:00" id="p4">
Pretty! Where is it from?
As for over your bed, how about using Hercules Hooks and a lightweight picture (maybe just a stretched canvas) with a wire hanger to go on the hook? Granted I have never been in an earthquake but I think because the wire is hooked on and the hook goes all the way into the wall and anchors, it might not be as dangerous as just hanging on a nail.

The heavy dark rug is throwing me off too. I love that bedding. I think some pretty, darker curtains and maybe some textured pillows (you know what I mean?) would make it look great.
Not sure about earthquake zone safe wall stuff though lol. Good luck with that!

<post author="juno" datetime="2012-04-03T22:49:00" id="p7">
Thanks for all the suggestions. The curtains are interlined and DH isn't going to let me replace them totally since I bought them less than a year ago, but I'm hoping maybe my mom can add some trim to them or even sew a completely new panel onto the front of them? I dunno. I'm not sure what you call textured pillows, but I'm thinking ruffles or something? Maybe chenille?
The bed is made from salvaged fir from our neighbor's garage tear-down using the Ana White farmhouse bed plan :) Not the easiest project, but really the hardest part was the lumber prep and the hand-rubbed lacquer finish. With new dimension lumber and painted like the plan calls for, I don't think it would be bad.
Bedding is from The Company Store.

Hm I really love the bedding w your bed and I think the rug an wall color are throwin me off. I think you need a lighter wall color. And a different rug. But it looks good as is I think too those 2 things might just really put it together for you.

I think I agree. However, this weekend I went from Behr Teepee Brown (a pretty dark taupe) to Antique White (much lighter). If I propose painting again within a week, DH will flip out completely. He's not amenable to change of any sort. Thus me being stuck with the curtains. I only told him about the new bedding after I purchased it, haha.

For me, it's totally the rug. It just doesn't seem to "go". Not sure how to explain. I picture a lighter, shag rug or something. Maybe? I like lighter airy bedrooms though. The paint and curtains are fine IMO.

<post author="FoxinFiji" datetime="2012-04-04T09:38:00" id="p11">
I really like it! I like it all actually. I would add two solid colored pillows that match the color of the design in the bedding and one fun accent pillow with pattern and maybe some of the colors that are in the rug.
I don't love in an earthquake zone but I would think if you find something you really love and won't be changing out for a long, long time you could just screw through the front of it on all four corners and hide them with paint. A framed piece of art, a stretched canvas, some carved wood art, etc. could all work there. For some reason one of the first things I thought of was that wooden cut out art that crate and barrel carried years ago. Do you know what I'm talking about? It was basically a bunch of boards biscuit jointed together and a leaf/vine motif cut out of it to create a negative shape. Then there was a small wooden frame around the whole thing. Something like that could be screwed right to the wall and the screw head hidden with wood putty.

Fox, I had fleetingly thought about screwing something directly into the wall, but hadn't really gotten as far as figuring how to make it not look like crap. Thanks for the suggestions. And I hate that I went to the trouble of putting up all my picture rails only to screw something in :) I guess if it's just in one place that's OK. I do have stuff hanging from the rail over the guest bed, but it's light and who cares about guests anywyay :P

Oh god. That one is definitely... something different. I love the ones that look like little petals. I know that PB (Or C&amp;B, can't remember which) had a felt pillow cover that had little felt circles sewn onto it. Different sizes but all the same colors, some layered. That sort of thing is more like it lol.

I didn't even think about the picture rail. Oh well you can use it everywhere else. LOL don't tell your guests that! We were thinking of doing the same thing because I would really like to have a round mirror over our bed someday. With it being a four post bed round things look best IMO between the tapered posts and round just lends itself to being a mirror vs. sometype of art.

experience with picking slabs of stone?
</headline>
<post author="socal_brid..." datetime="2012-04-03T18:28:00" id="p1">
last weekend we went to a stoneyard and found the most beautiful slab of carrara. it's got great veining, and even has touches of gold in it, which I've never seen on white carrara before. we put it on hold, and we'll be going back this weekend to find a second slab that we like (we'll need 2 slabs for our kitchen).
my question... when looking at slabs, did you just look at one or two because you liked them and figured there wasn't anything better in the stack, or did you look at all of the slabs in the pile to see every one? I feel like I want to look at the entire stack of slabs just so that I'm thorough, but not sure if that'll be really annoying to them (since it takes a bit of work to move them out of the way), or if I'm just being OCD about it. what was your experience?
</post>
<post author="decoraholi..." datetime="2012-04-03T19:46:00" id="p2">
I probably would have looked through the entire stack of slabs if they would have let me :) This was for granite, but I assume it's the same for marble. Most of the places we looked insisted that if they were from the same lot that the ones behind it would look almost the same. They don't like to move them because it can damage the stone. On our final pick I think I looked at the top 3 of the stack.
</post>
<post author="nicoleskr" datetime="2012-04-03T20:12:00" id="p3">
it's tons of work depending on space and availability of the crew to move each slab. If you don't love the slabs, look at the next one. Don't keep looking if you love one though- it makes it more confusing first of all, and honestly, if you like one your time is better spent doing something else.
But, that said, if you need 2 slabs, put 3 on hold. I've seen it too often that something happens to a slab making it not useable because of veining or breaking. You dont want to have to go back again. GL!
</post>
<post author="FoxinFiji" datetime="2012-04-04T09:01:00" id="p4">
Don't they have a picture of each slab as they inventoried it? Looking at all of them is unreasonable. It's not like flipping through small samples at the showroom. It takes a lot of man power and equipment to move each slab. If you get it and try to get another one or two from the same lot.
On a side note are you sure it's carrara? If I'm not mistaken there are different names for carrara that has gold streaks in it. Or it could be a different type of marble all together.
</post>
<post author="atlcatlove..." datetime="2012-04-04T09:44:00" id="p5">
Once we picked the color we liked we were told they would have us come back to view each slab individually to pick out the one/s we liked best. In the end we only needed one slab so we didn't have to go through that, but they were more than happy to accomodate us if that is what we had wanted or needed.
</post>
<post author="queenbone" datetime="2012-04-04T17:20:00" id="p6">
It depends upon how consistent the slabs are, but if you need 2 I'd ask to see at least 4 at your appointment and pick the two you like best. From those 4 you'll get a pretty good idea how consistent the veining would be in the rest of the stack.

To start if off:

Deputy mistakes pistol for Taser

<a href="http://msnbc.msn.com/id/13512149/">http://msnbc.msn.com/id/13512149/</a>

BREMERTON, Wash. - A sheriff's deputy who was trying to get a man down from a tree shot and wounded him after mistakenly pulling a gun instead of a Taser, authorities say.

The deputy, a five-year veteran of the force whose name was not released, was placed on leave while Thursday's shooting is investigated.

Deputies carry both a Taser and a gun on their utility belts. The Taser, or stun gun, is similar in shape to the compact.40-caliber gun the deputy carried, sheriff's spokesman Scott Wilson said.

The victim was listed in satisfactory condition.

The man had climbed a fig tree and stayed there for hours, talking to himself. Deputies were unsure whether he was intoxicated or psychotic, and they wanted to get him down before he hurt himself or others, Wilson said.

Deputies and rescue workers tried to coax him down for almost two hours, during which he became increasingly hostile, said David Blakeslee, an employee at an auto repair shop nearby.

Blakeslee said the man climbed down on his own after getting shot.

"He said, `Ow, that hurt. I'm coming down, I'm coming down,'" Blakeslee said.

Negative numbers - what a load of nonsense. <img src="http://www.worldaffairsboard.com/images/darksmiles/mad.gif"/>

For example: 2-1 = 1.
1-1= 0
All nice and sensible so far.

Then we get 1-2 = -1 (negative 1).

I agree. Math sucks ass. The crap they teach kids in high school is only of use to physicists and engineers and architects. Not everybody needs to know advanced algebra and geometry and trig. It's pointless.

Ditto. Leave the advanced math to those of us who actually care. Most people would do fine with no more advanced math than long division, multiplication, and maybe fractions and decimals. Sure I use trig some, but that's cause I'm weird.

And as far as science goes, what matters more than actual knowledge is the scientific view of life, which is almost non-existent in schools today it seems to me. If I was teaching science, I would initially concentrate on the history and philosophy of science, because that's how you get an idea of what it's really all about.

Of course, the schools would probably make it like a high school history course, where all you need to know are dates, people and other facts. <img src="http://www.worldaffairsboard.com/images/darksmiles/mad.gif"/> <img src="http://www.worldaffairsboard.com/images/darksmiles/frown.gif"/> It's history, people, from the French word for story. Make it a story, and people will love it. And as a bonus, I bet you would get a lot more kids interested in science.

Dude, once you master calculus, Algerbra is damned near obsolete. All those algebra problems that take half an hour to solve can be done in about 90 seconds with calculus. Unfortunately you have to crawl before you can walk. so the more you understand algebra and trig the easier calculus becomes. I suck at math, always have, and I struggled through a year of college calculus and I am glad I hung in there. A solid background in math opens up a lot of doors career wise, (read this as high paying jobs) and you will find you will use those math skills in ways you can not even imagine today.

Hm. I haven't taken a calc course yet, but I thought I understood the basics of differential calculus. Don't really know much about integrals, so that might be what you're talking about, but what I know of differentials has nothing to do with algebra. Good for finding out distance traveled during acceleration, and other problems dealing with changes over time, but finding x? I don't know, maybe you can explain what you're talking about. Also, could you give some examples of careers that calc skills require? Science/engineering, sure. Computers, yeah. Accounting, perhaps?

Liturature/English and history are equally important in their own right. There are a select few that are good at all subjects, but most of us are good at one or the other. Some people do better at math when they consider it a foreign language at treat it as such. Even when you are not doing math per se, you can still use the problem solving skills learned when doing math.

Some of these careers involve a math degree which includes Calculus and this is only a drop in the bucket: Research, marketing/sales, consultant, commerce, banking, marketing, analyst, statistition, engineer. You need to have some calc under your belt to get into most med schools (not so much for the calculus, but for the problem solving skills.)

Briefly, when finding high and low points on graphs, graphing curves, finding the local min and local max for optimization problems, and graphing in general, Calculus rules, Calculating change over time and the rate of change over time is best done with calculus. Calculus is also quicker to find the (x) in complex equations. You still use the rules of algebra, but calculus has lots of shortcuts so you could look at it as shorthand algebra. There are other examples as well, but that was too many years ago.

I originally hated math (except geometry) in high school because the Algebra teacher had absolutely no idea what practical applications it had in real life. However, in Physics class I excelled because I could "see" the math working inside the structures of levers, wheels, block and tackle, etc.

There is a difference between a mathematician who only knows ways of juggling numbers around that are totally meaningless. But then there are engineers and practical scientists that use math to build things and explain how and why things work.

I invented an engineering formula myself because I had a couple of steel rings on my desk that had undergone strength tests. One stretched a quarter of an inch and the other did not. Rourke's Formulas for Stress and Strain had no formula estimating the strength of a steel ring in tension. Engineering books by Shanley and Timoshenko had a meaningless formula because they admitted that for some strange reason the rings were always much stronger (when tested to destruction) than their formulas said they sould be. Taking other tests done on steel rings back in 1947 I started putting the numbers together and BACK engineered them. One engineer in my office suggested using the modulus of PLASTICITY instead of ELASTICITY that the "standard" formulas used. Of course. When trying to stretch a CIRCULAR steel ring, you are not actually trying to pull it apart as with a long link or elliptical shape. You are compressing the sides into each other. There were also two "K" factors included and I found by swapping them I came out with a formula that was within 5% of all rings tested to yield failure (not breaking, but permanent stretching).

So, teach the right kinds of math to the right kinds of people who would benefit most from it. If a student loves science class and likes to blow up rockets on the football field, lead him in the right direction of thermo-dynamics and structural strengths. If the student only likes to bake cakes, send him or her to chef's school (NOT just home economics).

This thread also mentioned history. I love history, but ONLY if it was written by Harold Lamb. He writes it as a novel, love story, adventure story, mystery story. It is not cut and dry with meaningless dates except as needed for comparisson as to what the rest of the world was like then.

But the biggest problem with schools is that they are stuck on teaching history starting with the dinosaurs and cave men. This is their "required" program in Elementary School, Junior High School, High School, Junior College and Senior College. By the time they get up to the 20th century, the semester has run out.

I realized this several years ago when we were having a family discussion and the phrase "Ask not what your country can do for you, but ask what YOU can do for your country" was quoted. I identified that as the acceptance speech by John F. Kennedy when he was elected President. Our daughter, who was in Junior College by then, said, "You know Dad, I've heard that speech many times before but never knew who said it."

BOOOOIIIIIINGGGG! What the hell is wrong with schools today? It turns out that, with luck, students might have enough time to get past the Civil War and maybe have a couple of hours left for a brief descripton of the Spanish American War.

No time for the Boxer Rebellion, First World War, depression of the 1930's, Second World War (and why WW I Treaty of Versailles caused it), invention of Penicillan, popularity of affordable Television sets, Korean War, invention of Salk and Sabin vaccines, Cuban Embargo, Viet Nam War, Race for the Moon, the transistor that led to the micro chip and today's computers and cell phones, etc. It is my firm belief that most of the events that happend in the 20th century have had more of an effect of who we are, why we are and how we are more so than all of the preceding centuries. Rome's conquest of Europe has no meaning to us anymore and Greek philosophies are only of interest to philosophers who have nothing else better to do ("Honey, when are you going to fix the fence?" "As soon as I get done doing a treatise on Plato vs Socrates")

I have heard of GALL STONES getting that big, but not KIDNEY STONES. I had to pass a kidney stone once. It was about the size of a full pepper seed. Coming out the final few inches of the urinary tract wasn't too bad as I knew I was finally getting rid of the damn thing.

But it was the excruciating lower back pains before as it began its blitzkrieg on out of the kidney.

One nurse wasn't too sympathetic and said, "Now you know what it feels like for a woman to give birth to a baby. Both are just as painful".

She made the mistake of saying that in front of my mother who strongly admonished her, "Bull. I've had three sons AND three kidney stones and the stones are MUCH worse."

I had a friend with kidney stones. He used to carry a prescription for Demerol in his wallet in case it got REALLY bad. One day I got a call from the police asking me if I would pick up his car. He had started to pass a stone while driving. Pulling over he almost ran over a cop who was giving someone a ticket. Luckily the officer was very understanding, calling an ambulance (and me). He finally did some kind of aquatic sonic wave therapy and was cured (for now).

I have heard of GALL STONES getting that big, but not KIDNEY STONES. I had to pass a kidney stone once. It was about the size of a full pepper seed. Coming out the final few inches of the urinary tract wasn't too bad as I knew I was finally getting rid of the damn thing.

But it was the excruciating lower back pains before as it began its blitzkrieg on out of the kidney.

One nurse wasn't too sympathetic and said, "Now you know what it feels like for a woman to give birth to a baby. Both are just as painful".

She made the mistake of saying that in front of my mother who strongly admonished her, "Bull. I've had three sons AND three kidney stones and the stones are MUCH worse."

ROFL

My mother had a gall stone about a 2cm in diameter... those are a bit less disguisting.. though I guess that they're not less unhealty.

But having a egg-sized stone in your bladder is certainly one of the few things that ultimately scares the sh!t out of me. Or imagining a pepper seed getting out...

That's weird. I was talking about that with my mom last night. Ever notice how almost all birds bob their heads when they walk? IIRC, that's actually because of the way they're built. They actually are not able to walk without bobbing their heads. Personally, I think sparrows hopping around are rather cute. I believe that they are capable of walking, but it's just not efficient for tiny birds like that. BTW, why parrots? I can't remember the last time I saw a parrot walking.

Usually the only time I see a parrot using its legs to move is when it goes from side to side on a perch in a cage.

Sparrows can move a lot faster by hopping than bigger birds can be walking normally.

Yes, it's rather obvious what Max thinks about me. Chloe Kitty on the other hand is friendly, if a bit skittish.

My current roomate has FOUR cats.

There's the Alpha Male that I refer to as "the mountain lion" because he's so freakin' huge. Not fat, huge.

There's the small, all-white female that I refer to as "the princess".

Also a small very young female longhair with a bushy tail that I used to call "little girl". But with a tail like that, she's now known by me as "little squirrel".

Finally, there is my favorite, Hemingway <img src="http://www.worldaffairsboard.com/images/darksmiles/redface.gif"/> He's just too cool for words. <img src="http://www.worldaffairsboard.com/images/darksmiles/biggrin.gif"/>

I'll put that on my to-do list. Be warned though- first I have to make my genetically engineered super soldiers, super fruit flies, a couple of tree species I want to save, and non-itch grass, so it might take some time.

Actually, rhinos and horses are in the same family IIRC. But you really wouldn't want a rhino horn, they're rather ugly. What you really want is a tusk, sheathed in ivory like an elephant tusk or boar tusk. Just instead of two have one, like the narwhal.

Crunching is impractical not because od being afraid of, but because there is a good possibility that you crunch the head and body goes away under something (or cleaning cockroach's intestine, if you dislike it). It happened to me few times, I used knife for killing them. After I heard that body could live a month without a head, I'm using flamethrower.

And yes, tadpoles are amphibians. Thought from what I have seen, reptiles are equally boring as pets - dumb and without interaction. And spiders, scorpions and bugs are definitely most pointless thing you could have. Dumb, ugly, squishy, poisonous...

you are correct - My minor was English in college (i wanted something to fall back on, in case my major did not pan out - wouldnt you know i did not follow either). while i dont use proper punctuation here on the board (it is far easier to type dont instead of don't with that pesky apostrophe).

so many people use that apostophe because it is hard to remember when and when not to use it, but it is not used with possessive pronouns such as his, her, my, yours, or its. it is only used with the word "it" when that word is being used as a contraction instead of "it is".

you know what else gets to me about the apostophe - that people do not use it correctly to make a singular word plural if that word ends in an "s". example: "look at those horses' hooves" requires an apostophe after the "s" but many people leave it off.

does anyone know how to reset the garage key pad password? (without actually knowing it) I have a liftmaster garage opener. I have tried putting in the 9999 possible combinations without success(must have missed some).

Just a random thought.

This is, after all, the Random Thread.

<img src="http://www.worldaffairsboard.com/images/smilies/smiles.gif"/>

See what happened to make me think of this was that this morning, my little one and I caught a monarch butterfly. I have a tattoo of a monarch but with a tiger face in it, which makes it a tiger butterfly, I guess.

Then later, we caught a giant toad and carried him a bit. I have pictures of her with him I will post as soon as I download them.

Then we went out and when we came back, there was a garden snake waiting for us on our patio. I was trying to catch him, and I had him held under a stick so I could grab his head and not get bit, but she grabbed for him instead and I let him go so she did not get bit (I have done good @ making sure she has not fear of them yet, and dont want a pesky little garden snake to change that). Then we lost him and I was not able to get him again.

When he was going off into the bushes, she said that maybe he will slither backwards, and I told her that they cant....

And that is where my random thought came from.

To remove the coils from cables. Hang from a tree or down a stairwell with a couple of kilos weight attached to the bottom overnight. Next morning it will lie flat.
To coil a cable: do the first coil in your hand the way you normally would, the next coil apply a twist with your fingers so when you lay that coil in your hand the cable passes inside/underneath the previous. This way each coil has a twist opposite the previous and when thrown out, each coil counters the other and the cable will lie flat.

so i have a short haired cat. most cats never go to the groomer to get haircuts. but when she was snipped, they shaved her tummy, and that fur grew back out to be the same length as the rest of her fur.

so my question is this: how does her fur know when to stop growing? how come it does not just keep getting longer like people's hair?

That's the difference between "hair" and "fur."

Hair continues to grow.

Fur stops at a certain length. I guess it stops at a certain length, falls out, and new one takes over. That's when we see shedding.

I wrote her off for the tenth time today
And practiced all the things I would say
But she came over
I lost my nerve
I took her back and made her dessert
Now I know I?m being used
That?s okay man cause I like the abuse
I know she?s playing with me
That?s okay cause I?ve got no self esteem
We make plans to go out at night
I wait till 2 then I turn out the light
All this rejection?s got me so low
If she keeps it up I just might tell her so
When she?s saying that she wants only me
Then I wonder why she sleeps with my friends
When she?s saying that I?m like a disease
Then I wonder how much more I can spend
Well I guess I should stick up for myself
But I really think it?s better this way
The more you suffer
The more it shows you really care Right?
Now I?ll relate this a little bit
That happens more than I?d like to admit
Late at night she knocks on my door
Drunk again and looking to score
Now I know I should say no
But that?s kind of hard when she?s ready to go
I may be dumb
But I?m not a dweeb
I?m just a sucker with no self esteem

Nope, I don't like being young. I've always been more mature than my peers, which made it more difficult for me to fit in and to relate. My childhood hasn't been much fun, and I'm ready to move on.

Nope. I just never really got into it. Some of the earlier episodes were funny, but now they're all really, really bad. I watch it occasionally, and I may get a single chuckle out of an entire episode. Maybe. I just think it's really overrated.

Yeah, the recent episodes really sucked. It's not satire about a current event or an institution any more. It's just cheap shots at the conservatives. I think the original writers left and were replaced by left leaning loons. <img src="http://www.worldaffairsboard.com/images/darksmiles/mad.gif"/>

Yep, the original writers did leave and were replaced by the morons who aren't creative or funny in any way. This is in direct contrast to shows like King of the Hill and South Park, whose writers have been the same since their conception. Hence, why they're a lot more creative and funny.

It's just going to turn out to be a wierdo like the rest of the Scientologists. I mean honestly, how can anybody with a shred of logic believe the strangeness that Scientologists believe in? Is it pride, stubborness, or just plain stupidity?

There comes a certain point in religion where faith is not the question, logic is. Sure, there are some aspects of major world religions that people may find hard to believe, but at one point the line must be drawn.

It was the strangest thing ever. El Paso's soil is very poor when it comes to retaining water, and the city itself has a large mountain dividing it, hence, all the water runs downhill, which is how such a thing could happen.

Hot here too today. We stayed in except for one mini trip to the gas station 1st thing in the morning so that we could enjoy cookie crisp and then one mini trip in the early evening to get corn flakes and marshmallows to make a rice crispie treat concoction (without the rice crispies) for the child to take to daycare tomorrow.

My aunt makes these @ XMas time and colors the marshmallows green before she mixes them all up and then puts some red cinnamon hearts on top to make them look like holly. Instead of putting in into a pan like rice crispie treats, you just make blobs of them and let them cool. I like these with corn flakes better than rice crispie treats.

A couple of "co-workers" and I danced at the opening at a fashion show today. The DJ was a complete moron, unable to follow the simple instructions to fade the songs after two minutes, instead abruptly cutting them and screwing up the exits. Even after being reminded the DJ failed to follow the simple instructions. Other than almost tripping on a crack in the floor, the show went relatively well.

During another visit to the firing range, I received the opportunity to fire 2 more new weapons to me: the M1 Carbine and Ishapore Enfield in.308.

First was the Enfield. I like the U-notch rear sights much, much better than the apeture sights on the No. 4 rifle. Recoil was milder as well. The bolt action was rather stiff but functional. All in all a nice rifle.

The M1 Carbine was a blast. Very lightweight, light recoil as expected, and nice sights combined to make a very fun gun to shoot. I hit a target at 100 yards 6 times in a row. I'd get one if not for the price.

None of this would've been possible if not for the very polite fellow shooters that are out there. Usually all one has to do is offer a try or two with your gun and then they will let you give theirs a shot. Some of the nicest, most polite people in my city are to be met there. They are almost always white. Mexicans tend to be rude and bossy, although a few are very kind. <img src="http://www.worldaffairsboard.com/images/darksmiles/confused.gif"/>

I'm embarassed of him too. He's not even remotely funny now. His old "be as obnoxious as possible and hope people will laugh" routine, only somewhat humorous, is now gone, replaced by a very bland and uninteresting "normal" routine.

Him, Rob Schneider, and a few others seem to be made for those stupid, plotless and boring movies that are pretty much interchangeable.

"Water water everywhere, and all the boards did shrink,
Water water everywhere, nor any drop to drink..."

It's been flooding here for the past several days. Huge amounts of rain and several busted water mains have led to the destruction of many homes and businesses. Fortunately I live in an area that wasn't too badly hit, and the worst my house suffered was a few leaks in the roof. However, at one point it was bad enough that the state declared a state of emergency and the flooding was the worst the city has had since 1881. This was several days ago, and still many roads and byways are closed due to flooding.

Actually the power held up surprisingly well. Lights flickered a lot but the electricity was never shut off, although the same certainly can't be said for the houses whose water level reaches up to about a person's chest. <img src="http://www.worldaffairsboard.com/images/darksmiles/eek.gif"/>

I dont care what Mel Gibson did or said or who he breathed on. I dont want to hear him apologize for remarks he made about any group of people or even for getting plastered and trying to go for a joy ride. I dont care if he was drunk when he made the comments or if he was being forced to say them @ gunpoint. I dont care that he played Jesus in a movie and I dont care if Jesus was or was not Jewish.

I remember the first time my beard came off. Scared the snot out of me. Hadn't seen my whole face in about two years. I couldn't look in a mirror for a couple of days without cringing. It was almost as bad ast the time my dad shaved without warning us. I'm at the breakfast table and I look up at him, and then do a complete double take. It was like a stranger was eating breakfast with us. Freakiest thing ever.

As President Bush is getting off the helicopter in front of the White House, he has a baby pig under each arm.
The Marine guard snaps to attention, salutes, and says: "Nice pigs, sir." The President replies: "These are not pigs, these are authentic Texan Razorback Hogs. I got one for VP Cheney, and I got one for Defense Secretary Rumsfeld." The Marine again snaps to attention, salutes, and replies, "Nice trade, sir."

My daughter has my graceful abilities...of which I have none.

Really, I could find a way to get injured if I were naked in a pool full of nerf balls. So today we had a red Icee and the last of it had melted. I had to walk the garbage out to the dumpster anyway so she brought that cup with us. We got out there and b4 I could stop her, reached up, lifted the lid of the dumpster the whole inch and a half that she could and tried to put the cup into the dumpster. Only when she attempted this, she turned the cup completely upside down, spilling red melted Icee juice on her head, in her face, on her clothes and even onto her feet. I stood there in disbelief since this is something that anyone who knows me would expect to happen to me. When she turned around and looked at me she was covered in red juice.

I recently upgraded my computer and I thought I did a pretty good job.

I wanted a new video card so I can play all the new games. But all the new cards use PCIe interface, so I needed a new motherboard. The new motherboard needed a new processor since there are no PCIe socket A boards in existance. The new card/board/processor consumed more power so I needed a new power supply.

End result: I kept the old RAM, old case, old floppy drive, and gutted everything else.

New system:
Athlon64 X2 3800+ clocked at 2.2GHz @ stock voltage
Geforce 7900GT clocked at 530MHz
Seasonic 430W power supply with up to 85% efficiency
1GB of DDR433 RAM retained from old system
36GB WD Raptor drive I bought 2.5 years ago as an incremental upgrade
250GB Seagate drive

I can play all the new games now without lag. <img src="http://www.worldaffairsboard.com/images/darksmiles/biggrin.gif"/>

If people could just leave their grimy little fingers off of stuff that does not belong to them and not remove things from retailers that they so obviously did not pay for I would not have just cut my hand trying to open a freaking Fairytopia Freakin' Barbie!! What the hell is all that anyway? Twisty ties, plastic clips, staples, her hair was SEWN to the cardboard box. SEWN!! A mother should not need security clearance from Mattel and a freaking machete to open Crystal the Freakin' Jewled Fairy.

In my day there were three steps to playing with a Barbie:

1. Open the box top
2. Remove Barbie
3. Remove that piece of plastic wrap they put over her head to keep her hair in place

Voila!!

Now there are a minimum of 6 twist ties, plastic pieces that wrap around her in the front, go through the back of the cardboard insert, and then are taped with some NASA invention to the back of the box. In addition, her head has gone through a singer machine so that you have to use a seam ripper to get her face off the box.

Next time I am cutting her at the neck, both legs and the arms and the child will get a pretty pink Barbie abdomen to play with since that is the only thing not secured.

Who Designed This Crap? Product Packaging, Where's My Chainsaw?
Barry Gerber
August 9, 2006 10:33

Cut, Cut, Gash, Gash
Mobile computers and accessories are cool. However the way they're packaged is a real horror show, almost literally. With impenetrable shipping envelopes and boxes as well as plastic blister packs sealed tighter than most tombs, it seems like vendors really don't want you to get to their products.

I had been thinking off and on about making a bid on an auction of some property being sold for a federal levy. Today when I went to the bank to get money to get a hair cut I thought while I was there,"why not" and got a cashiers cheque for the deposit so I could bid. When I got home I realized I got it for the wrong (not enough) amount. I rushed back to the bank and got there four minutes after closing time. The auction is tomorrow (Sunday) and the banks are closed. Talk about shooting yourself in the foot. <img src="http://www.worldaffairsboard.com/images/darksmiles/redface.gif"/>

I used to feel the same way, but I have been thinking of taking a golf class for no reason other than additional advancement in the company. Everytime I hear anyone talk about anything, it was done over a game of golf. They fly around the country to play golf. I have been invited and I have to laugh. I pity anyone who comes within 6 feet of me and a golf club - even a mini golf putter. It'd be dangerous.

I have managed to advance in the two years I have been there and would like to continue and fear golf would give me an advantage...or at least let me get to travel around for no reason other than to chase a white ball with a stick and try not to get it in the water.

If it were not for all that, I'd have no interest. But who knows, maybe if I understood it I'd feel different.

Tiger Woods is one of the finest players of golf and will become a legend like Jack Nicklaus.

Therefore, one has to get used to this fact that Tiger Woods will always be there whenever golf is played or thought or spoken about.

It is not a "stick". It is a "club".

And golf is not such an easy game either.

And golf is a game where you cannot blame anyone, not even the referee or linesman, if you mess up your game.

A great game to play.

And the great feeling of being with Mother Nature in all her elements!

You must do a round of golf in blinding rain. It is such fun!

I was brushing my dog after a long walk when I noticed she had a red swollen area around a single fresh puncture wound in front of her chest. My thought was maybe a nonlinear snake bite? Yeah right, I mean have you ever seen a one toothed rattlesnake? I guess that would be ole Snaggletooth!
I have seen two rattlesnakes in as many weeks. I figured wait and see.Two hours later the swelling was noticeably increased so I took the dog the the "emergency" vet because it's Sunday. X rays showed a BB pellet had bounced of her ribcage and lodged just forward of her shoulder. The dog is going to be OK. <img src="http://www.worldaffairsboard.com/images/smilies/smiles.gif"/> You don't want to know how much this cost me. <img src="http://www.worldaffairsboard.com/images/darksmiles/rolleyes.gif"/>

My internal clock is all messed up. My dog and I always "stand to" mornings and evenings by taking long walks. Now she's on "light duty", meaning no walks per doctors orders.

Ah but then "Clud" does have different connotations.

The type of club that you allude to, would not be what I think is a Club (
Captial 'C'). It would be a place where I can take my guests for a quick drink, snacks, small talk and maybe dinner and cigar! Memebrs only <img src="http://www.worldaffairsboard.com/images/darksmiles/wink.gif"/>

Not wind.

Golf is a game for the sophisticated. Breeze would be more appropriate. Wind would be like "breaking wind". Though I admit that can mess up a stroke!

My Dobie liked going to the vet. She would walk in an I would have a heck of a time keeping her in the waiting room, she always wanted to get back into one of the exam rooms where she would stand up and put her front paws on the table until the Dr came in. Then when it was all over, she would go up to the front desk and stand up again waiting for a treat from them. The only thing she did not like was that big walk on scale (don't blame her, really - what female like to discuss her weight after all). she really hated standing on that scale and would shake the whole time.

How far does this Nerf foam football travel?

It would be odd if it only flounced around instead of shooting out!

</quote>

Sorry, I was out of town for a few days and forgot about this thread.

Nerf football is good for around 20 meters, I think. It's been a while since I tossed one. Even though it's made of foam, it can hurt if hits the right spot like the nose. It's also smaller than a traditional football to fit kids' smaller hands. I think I stopped playing with it when my hands were too big to throw one comfortably.

Ah, the good old days of Nerf. <img src="http://www.worldaffairsboard.com/images/darksmiles/biggrin.gif"/>

I used to have this bow and arrow, the arrow being made out of Nerf (if it's a material at all). The bow had a hole in the middle of it for the arrow to pass through. Unfortunately, the fletching on the arrow made it too wide for it to pass through the hole.

I really suck at hitting a golf ball. My hockey habit dictates that my stick blade hits the ground before it contacts the puck. Naturally my golf swing has my club contact the ground before it hits the ball.

Most men I've met don't own evening wear, they rent it. It follows that most men don't know how to tie a bow tie. I learned originally from a diagram in the encyclopedia Britannica. I wore a suit and tie every day (except for Fridays) for many years. For me it was just another uniform.

My high school English teacher made an interesting observation. In America, he said, the clock runs. In Spanish-speaking countries, the clock walks (caminar). In France, the clock marches.

The meaning? American society is fast-paced, so it runs. Latin American societies are slower, so it walks. And when the saying was made up in France, Napoleon was at the height of his military success, so the clock marches. So it's merely a reflection on how the societies operate.

Yeah, I felt the same way about "Annapolis" and "The Girl in the Basement", both of which I watched this weekend. Annapolis was not bad, but I did not think it was going to be one of those "triumph of the black sheep of the family" movies. As for the girl in the basement...the cover looks good, the acting is nothing short of horrendous, the idea is not so bad. Critic Emily gives it two thumbs down - even a relativelty nice looking main character and a bottle of rum could not save this one.

Have to agree with you on that. But then, I'm not a big fan of the Leatherstocking Tales as a whole.

What they hate even more (not that I have tried this on a small Russian Blue feline companion of mine) is to take a long piece of tape, wrap it loosely aroud the end of their tail and then wrap the rest the same way as when it is put on the bottoms of their paws, only longways.

I also do not like the square bread. There are loaves that are completely square - something is not right about that, it should be nicely rounded on top.

Well I don't know what that means...I am a joy to live with and a constant pleasure to be around - just ask my family or better yet, my ex-prisoner, I mean ex-husband. <img src="http://www.worldaffairsboard.com/images/darksmiles/wink.gif"/>

Seriously though, there are dates stamped in permanent ink on food items for a reason. They are recommendations from the people who know that particular food item the best - the person who actually put it in its little container, wrapper or jar.

Food expiration is nothing to take lightly...it is a serious matter often overlooked by the people it affects the most - The consumer!!

While you sit there, dear TH, laughing at your monitor as I know you are, I emphasize that I am not joking - as you know I am not. More than just a safety concern, it is a matter of health and well-being. Serious things happen to food as it ferments and this should not be chuckled at.

As a matter of fact, I was at the store this very morning getting steak, eggs and tortillas for breakfast and I noticed that the tortillas on the shelf had an expiration date of sometime in July!!!! JULY!!! At least it was this year. Now you know I was annoyed that I had to bring some of those around the store until I found someone who I thought was competant enough to remove the rest from the shelf. Outrageous, I say!!

Yes, and as I've tried to explain on many occasions, there is just a little bit of "padding" involved in those dates.
Milk doesn't instantly curdle into cottage cheese at midnight on that expiration date. <img src="http://www.worldaffairsboard.com/images/darksmiles/wink.gif"/>

So I have this cell phone that I bought at Tiger. Everytime I check my voice mail I get a text message that is a picture of an antenna and the '@' sign. Not that big of a deal really, just annoying to have to clear a text message everytime I check my voice mail. <img src="http://www.worldaffairsboard.com/images/darksmiles/frown.gif"/>

So I call my cell phone company and since this is not a T-Mobile phone or a phone that they can reference, they cannot offer tech support. They refer me to Motorola since it is a Motorola phone...makes sense, right?

So I call them tonight and I explain the problem to Boy Wonder at Motorola. After a few minutes I convince him that T-Mobile does not sell these phones and that I did not buy this at T-Mobile (he kept telling me I had to have bought it there).

The next step is to get some phone code. He tells me to remove the battery and the code is on a sticker under the battery. <img src="http://www.worldaffairsboard.com/images/darksmiles/confused.gif"/> I explain to him that if I remove the battery, the call will disconnect. The freakin genius on the other end of the phone actually asks me "Are you sure?" HE'S TECH SUPPORT, PEOPLE!! <img src="http://www.worldaffairsboard.com/images/darksmiles/mad.gif"/> We get through that, he puts me on hold and comes back with another way to get his code.

After I sit on hold - Again - He comes back and says that my phone was manufactured outside the US (No freakin way!! An electronic device from another country - SHOCKING ! <img src="http://www.worldaffairsboard.com/images/darksmiles/eek.gif"/> Call the media!)

So at this point I realize that there is nothing the Einstein on the other end of the phone can do for me and the call was quickly losing its entertainment value, plus he started babbling about something.

So I ask him flat out "There is nothing you can do, is there?" He gets excited and says "Yes. There is something I can do to help you out." Finally! Mr Helpful wants me to send my 'foreign' cell phone (he actually called it 'foreign') to Motorola and they will send me a new one; the same kind, color and all. I start to think how many days I could go without a cell phone when Dealin' Dave mentions that I will also have to send $175. <img src="http://www.worldaffairsboard.com/images/darksmiles/eek.gif"/>

I repeat to him, to make sure I got it all, that I am suppose to buy a new phone from Motorola as well as give them my current cell phone and then I won't get the text message when I check my voice mail...

I kept my phone - I'll deal with the text message.

Pune is an interesting town.

Near Pune is a place called Khadakvasla where we have the National Defence Academy. I was a cadet there 1963 Jan onwards.

It is a fabulous place, do visit it.

If you go there, let me know. I will organise a visit for you.

Pune is an University town.

1.30am, driving home from a late shift at work &amp; 10 or so 18-20 yr old drunk kids had decided to put traffic cones across the road and stand round o the footpath elling and yahooing. I get out of the car and toss the cones off the road and turn round to them and tell them to **** off home. 5 minutes of yelling at me and threatening 'dire consequences' at me they did.
Interesting thing, 3 or 4 of them looked like they wanted to go me and would start to walk up to me but I'd stare them down, none of them came closer than 10 feet. I guess even in my advanced years I still look scary enough to face them down <img src="http://www.worldaffairsboard.com/images/smilies/smiles.gif"/>

LOL, you could tell by my poor post I pulled a double shift last night.
Umm, nothing non violent about me, which is what pleased me so much in that I must still look the part. I think me yelling at them louder than they could yell at me might have helped as well.
They all looked so young, like little children that I'd break if I wasn't careful. Funny old world really.

17 reasons why I love WAB.
</headline>
<post author="YellowFever" datetime="2011-06-29T00:42:00" id="p1">
1) Love the fact that many people around the world gather here to discuss their differing view and sometimes even get into heated arguments but are mature enough to leave it where it is and help each other out with information and answers the other might need.

2) Love the way when a "Obama is to blame for this" thread appears, Rosie will always chime in with a "Oh yeah, well, Bush did this" post....always invariably followed by a gunnut "Two wrongs don't make a right" post.

3) Love the way the mods/admins, when confronted with a new troll, take differing approaches to dispatch them.
Pari for instance, will play with the troll the way a cat might play with a mouse, almost in a sadistic way before killing him with extreme prejudice.
The Colonel, never the one for preambles, swings the hammer as soon as he sees a troll, all the while ignoring the pleas of the peasants to keep the troll just a little bit longer for everyone to nibble on. Now, he has added a new wrinkle to his game. He always asks the peasants "How long do you want to keep this chew toy?" Guilty conscious?
Julie, is the wild card. She treats trolls the way Cruella De Ville might treat a dalmatian.

4) Love the way gunnut hijacks threads. It's like a Jedi mind trick. We know it's happening but everybody is powerless to stop it and ultimaterly goes along with it.

5) Love the way Benny posts an article or youtube video about the Israeli/Palestine subject every few days and it pisses off a newbie enough to sign up and argue about it for 7 to 10 pages. And after that, the newbie dissapears......never to be seen again.

6) Love the way dalem signs off EVERY SINGLE POST with a "Dale" signature.

7) Love the way when a stupid thread goes on for a few pages, filled with bad jokes and unfunny stories....and just as it is about to die a welcomed death...... Rusty invariably shows up to post something serious in that thread.

8) Love the way Whiskey posts pictures of every single @#$%^&amp; Uke he ever buys or acquires! <img src="http://www.worldaffairsboard.com/images/darksmiles/mad.gif"/> <img src="http://www.worldaffairsboard.com/images/darksmiles/biggrin.gif"/>

9) Love the way highsea, Ggtharos, gf or Jimmy throws these tidbits of information at us @ the Aviation threads. They're always of things I've never knew or were even aware of before.

10) Ditto Rusty, Gunny, Dreadnought and a few others @ the Naval threads.

11) Love the way Mihais writes posts after posts without paragraphs, punctuation marks, question marks, and exclamation points.......just periods (many.....many of them).

12) Love the way tankie writes the same.......drunk or sober.

13) love the way I bitch and put down every single song S2 and Bigfella posts in the "What songs are you listening to" thread and then turning right around and downloading them and fallling in love with them...although I can't tell them that. <img src="http://www.worldaffairsboard.com/images/darksmiles/biggrin.gif"/>

14) The seemingly easy way every single threads could be turned into a subject about sammiches.

15) I love the way every three weeks to a month, Furky will drop by with a "Hey, I've been away for awhile....what's happening here?" post. It's like clockwork.

16) Ditto Debbie with her road kill stories or "men are here to please me" posts.

17) This picture:

Very bored. <img src="http://www.worldaffairsboard.com/images/darksmiles/frown.gif"/>

So I managed to talk the missus into goingt away for a few days. <img src="http://www.worldaffairsboard.com/images/darksmiles/biggrin.gif"/>

She was in the kitchen and I asked her, "Julie, I'm bored. I want to go somewhere."

Whereupon she said, "OK, things are kinda boring at work too. Where do you want to go?"

And I responded, "Vegas, baby! Let's take a few days off and leave tomorrow (today). I already made reservations at the Aria!"

So she said, "Cool! Let me make some sammiches for our journey!" <img src="http://www.worldaffairsboard.com/images/darksmiles/biggrin.gif"/>

So....I'll see you guys probably around Independence Day!
Oh, and if any of you are in LV, gimme a buzz. I'll be the cool looking guy with a hot chick in my arms. And no, I don't mean Benny. <img src="http://www.worldaffairsboard.com/images/darksmiles/cool.gif"/>

For future reference, yella and if you ever find yourself in Indian company. The number 420 has an embezzlement connotation. If you refer to someone by that number you're implying they're crooks. If you call them an 840 then its doubly as bad.

So it's a bit curious that of all the hours &amp; minutes in the day you just so happened to have chosen that time over any other. Does this mean good fortune coming your way in LV ? Enjoy.

POKER! There's a reason the good poker players always seem to make it to the finals in those giant tournaments, and it isn't luck.

The problem with craps is that it is a very fast game. You win big, or lose big, quickly. Usually it's lose big. :(

Actually, chogy, in my experience (and I have alot in poker) it's more like 70% luck and 30% skills.

The reason why you see the same idiots in the final tables are because they enter every single tournament. They're bound to make some final tables.

I feel good.

My wife can go shoe shopping on our way back.

I just saw the sexiest woman alive....too bad my wife was with me.

Just as well........I don't think she's a very good sammich maker.

Didn't meet Celine in Vegas......

The meteorologist lied to me. It wasn't 105 degrees in Vegas. It was 121 degrees (yes, 121)....

Won alot @ the craps table.....

Lost everything I won @ the craps table and alot more @ the Black Jack Table.....

I actually broke the all-in-one remote control thingie in the room.....

Wondering what happened to that fat guy that was in front of me @ Saturday Champagne Brunch because he had two plates stacked with Snow Crabs at least a foot high in both...

Saw a bald-headed skinny guy in 70's style John Travolta disco clothes, went up to him and said, "Hey TJ,, fancy meeting you here.". No lie, I said that and the guy looked at me weird.

Talked my wife into making me a sammich @ the deli section of the Champagne Brunch..because I thuoght it would be cool, just for kicks and giggles so I can write about it on WAB.

Went down to the pool, saw another cute chick and thought I'd show her my six pack....only to learn my six pack has turned into a keg.....

Wife went to the spa treatment and got the full works and it costed me almost as much as the shoes and outfit...

I saw over 15 cars over-heating on the highway on that big hill between Primm and Baker on the way back (gunnut and AR knows which hill I'm talking about). Laughed my ass off at their troubles while the wife leered at me....

Took some cool pics of the wife in her bikini and was going to post it here but....What happens in Vegas...stays in Vegas.....

Reason number 18 why I love the WAB:
Great bathroom reading when you've come up to the room, after losing all your money at the tables @ 4 in the morning......

I've been wanting to ask but resisted for fear of jumping uninvited into an old private board joke amongst the old timers.

Is this sammich thing really a sandwich (the one we eat) or some deeper sexual innuendo (position or fetish specific for instance)? <img src="http://www.worldaffairsboard.com/images/darksmiles/confused.gif"/>

No no, a sammich is something we wish the wimmenfolk would make us. A sammich comes with two slices of bread and some sort of meat inside, usually. Julie made me a sammich a couple weeks ago, meaning I'm not gonna be getting any more sammiches for a while

For your information, a "sammich" is a slang for getting tied up, wearing nothing but a thong with a ball-gag in your mouth and getting whipped by Julie while she degrades you by calling you a wuss.

Now you know why Benny likes it so much and why Julie needs a new whip every few weeks.

She only charges a a carton of cigarettes and a six pack for it so give it a try.

It's actually fun to watch until Pari tries to talk Julie into getting the sheep involved......

Reason number 20 why I love WAB so much.

It has my very own Las Vegas diary as a sticky.

Seeing as how I hate turkey, my wife has surprised me with a trip to Las Vegas.

Leaving Thanksgiving morning out of Bob Hope Airport so there will not be any shoe shopping this time so the Colonel will not have the satisfaction of reading about my suffering at any outlets.

I tried to talk her into driving up there again, as Thanksgiving day is the best day of the year to drive to LV (took me less than 3 hours last time I drove up there on turkey day) but she would have none of that so she threatened me that it's either an airplane to LV or dinner at my sister's house with a Turkey.

And since I see turkies everyday here on WAB, I chose the former.

Since I won't have a car this time around, my plan is to stand in front of the fountains @ the Bellagio in shorts and drink something alcoholic until I sweat in bitter cold (bitter cold being defined as around 45 degrees).

Also, there was this asshole dealer at Aria that kept smirking whenever I lost a hand at Black Jack the last time I was there.

As soon as my wife leaves me alone to go to the Shoppes at Ceasar's Palace, I'm going to find him and kick his ass while screaming, "look who's busted now, bitch!" <img src="http://www.worldaffairsboard.com/images/darksmiles/mad.gif"/>

I'm also hoping to take a long walk around the boulevard, contemplating how I could better serve my fellow man as it's almost deserted Thanksgiving night before these same scum fellow men come screaming in on Friday after Thanksgiving.

<post author="Tarek Morgen" datetime="2011-03-22T20:41:00" id="p1">
With deep appreciation and gratitude, we, the members and staff of the World Affairs Board take great pleasure in presenting to

COL WAYLAND YU,

this time-honoured sword bearing the insignia of the Corps of Royal Engineers.

Due to his unwavering leadership, excellent insights and contributions, the World Affairs Board has grown to a greater stature, and today stands as a premier politico-military forum. He always has and continues to be a generous mentor, a good friend, and a fierce opponent in debate for our community.

On behalf of the members and staff of the World Affairs Board:

I have to admit that this posting is quite a bit late. The Sword for the Colonel for his Semi-retirement had been bought several months ago. Sadly shipping an antique sword through several countries is a lot harder than one might think. Luckily it did recently arrive where it belongs. Yet I am somewhat disappointed in myself that I was not able to do this on the 11th of march as planned...so I would have an excuse to sue the following clip:

(not that I would let that stop me anyway).

The gift was organized by pretty much the whole staff (active and retired). I am sure that there are many more members on WAB who would also have contributed if asked, but we tried to keep the group manageable small, to prevent the Colonel from learning about this too early.

All I can give you Sir, is my heartfelt words to you in saying the gift is just a drop in the bucket compared to your abundance of givingness to WAB, and the sword is just as unique as you are.

Police Say Man Breaks Into Celine Dion's Home; Raids The Fridge &amp; Seeks A Bath

First Posted: 9/7/11 08:27 AM ET Updated: 9/7/11 10:59 AM ET

MONTREAL — A unidentified Col in the Canadian Armed Forces has been charged after he allegedly broke into singer Celine Dion's home near Montreal, raided the fridge and even took the time to pour himself a bath, police said Tuesday.

He was nabbed by police in the Montreal suburb of Laval on Monday afternoon after the alarm system went off.

The international pop superstar and her husband, Rene Angelil, were not at home at the time. Dion and Angelil usually live in Florida but use the Laval residence when they come home to Quebec.

Laval police spokesman Franco Di Genova said the suspect was getting ready to take a nice hot bath when police arrived with a canine unit.

"He opened the water faucets, was pouring a nice warmish bath (and) he even managed to eat some pastry that was in the fridge," Di Genova said.

Di Genova said police worked their way through the house, starting with the basement and finally confronted the man on the main floor.

"The suspect was coming down the big staircase and was asking: `Hey, guys what are you doing here?'" Di Genova said.

"So the officers replied: `What are you doing here?' and they proceeded to put him under arrest."

Di Genova said the man had jumped a fence in white fuzzy high heels to get on the property and used a garage door opener that he found in an unlocked vehicle to gain access to the luxury residence.

He that shall not be named, a Canadian resident, was arraigned Tuesday on charges including breaking and entering, auto theft and causing property damage such as leaving behind several expensive cigar stubs, empty bottles of some of the finest single malt scotch and stealing a pair of white fuzzy high heeled shoes.

Di Genova said there was another incident at Dion's mansion in 2009 when another man jumped the fence, but was stopped by the security firm that was keeping an eye on the property before he could enter the home.

She, that shall not be named was not available for comment.

Hmmm, me thinks she that shall not be named might have had some Single Malts and fine cigars lingering. <img src="http://www.worldaffairsboard.com/images/darksmiles/eek.gif"/> <img src="http://www.worldaffairsboard.com/images/smilies/innocent0009.gif"/>

</quote>

At first, this sounds like a good idea especially since there have been some postings on the latest sci-fi massive destruction movie.

But then somebody will want to start a sub-forum for Television. This would have to be split up into several sub-sub-forums; one for Made For TV Movies, one for Series TV dramas, one for Series TV comedies, one for Series TV Science Fiction, one for Sports, one for Documentaries --- well, you know what I mean.

What category would you put Mike Rowe's "Dirty Jobs" in or "How Is It Made?".

Then there's "Top Shot" that sadly is just "Survivor" except with guns, knives, arrows, etc. "Sons of Guns" is recent and very liberal in showing you how to make a machine gun. It seems like everybody in Louisiana has a FFL to own full auto firearms and sawed-off shotguns.

Where would you put "Pawn Stars" and "American Pickers". Do they fit in with "Antique Road Show" and various "Auction" shows cropping up like weeds?

Some shows could also cause debates such as why my heart rate went dangerously high everytime Kristin Kreuk appeared on "Smallville".

Besides, there are other TV forums on the Internet but they could be bad for the show. I wrote in comments on every episode of R. Lee Ermey's new show "Lock and Load" pointing out things the producers missed and how lengthy the recaps were after each commercial break. It's no longer on anymore. Should have kept my mouth shut but I couldn't let it go by that their episode on tanks omitted an entire series of Pershing, Patton &amp; Walker tanks between WW II and Viet Nam.

And finally, the only movies I could comment on are those on disk or tape as I don't go to movie theaters anymore. So any thoughts I would have would be too late to be of interest. As a matter of fact, theater attendance has been down for quite a while because we feel like smugglers sneaking in our own popcorn and sodas without breaking the family budget at break time in the lobby.

So, let's just keep it at movie reviews. As I said, there are lots of other Web Sites for TV shows.

I have seen a little of this on WAB (and some pretty good stuff too, I especially admired Bill's "Farewell to a Soldier"), but other than the random thread, it doesn't seem to fit well anywhere (maybe the Field Mess and the Pub are possible venues as well?, maybe sticky threads here are enough?).

Does anyone else think subjects like this belong here?

<a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/9120773/The-first-breath-of-a-person.html">The first breath of a person</a>

<quote>
I suppose one cannot accuse Francesca Minerva and Alberto Giubilini of a lack of nerve. As the co-authors of a paper in the Journal of Medical Ethics <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/9113394/Killing-babies-no-different-from-abortion-experts-say.html">declaring that newborn babies do not ?have a moral right to life?</a>, they do not appear to have been concerned by the fact that justifying infanticide does not generally lead one to the top, unless one is Herod or Hitler, neither of whom have been particularly well regarded by history. Indeed, the idea of harming a newborn child is widely seen as one of the most disgusting of all acts, whether carried out in war, genocide or domestic fury.
Like many others, I at first assumed that the authors? upholding of the principle of ?post-birth abortion? was some kind of acutely pitched satire, designed to make readers re-examine the ethics of abortion itself. It appears not.
The gist of the argument is that newborns, like foetuses, must be classed as ?potential persons? rather than ?actual persons?, because the authors ?take 'person? as someone who is capable of attributing to her own existence some (at least) basic value such that being deprived of this existence represents a loss to you?. In other words, ?the moral right to life? depends on your being intellectually conscious enough to know that you wouldn?t like to lose that life.
I don?t know whether, at any point while the authors refined this somewhat tortuous argument, they were actually viscerally repelled by the notion of killing newborn babies. Perhaps they told themselves that repulsion was a lowly sensation which they must suppress, and that they were honour-bound to follow the higher path of logic all the way to infanticide. Of course, if logic is flawed or divorced from compassion, it can lead one to a very bad place indeed.
Yet there is a consistency between the view of the authors and those who abhor abortion in any circumstance: both groups place newborns and foetuses in essentially the same camp, in which the moment of birth itself has little meaning. In the authors? view, neither foetuses nor newborns are ?actual persons? and therefore both could be justifiably extinguished according to the superior will of adults. In the view of anti-abortionists, both newborns and foetuses are indeed ?actual persons? and the termination of either is wholesale murder. I would prefer the latter argument to the former, of course, but I don?t quite agree with it either.

It would be a moral and intellectual relief to cling to a clean line of logic all the way from conception to birth, and argue that a fertilised human egg should be every bit as valuable to humanity as a newborn baby. But I don?t think it is, and not just because I cannot bring myself to condemn a woman who undergoes an early abortion for serious reasons, despite the lurch of sadness such news triggers.
A woman?s sense of loss at miscarrying after a few weeks ? an event about which she might even be unaware ? is quite different in scale from her grief at miscarrying at five months, and further again from the trauma of stillbirth. A foetus tends to accrue value from the moment of its conception, in line with the mother?s physical and emotional investment in its existence.
These are arguments in shades of grey, in messy territory, and at various points they make me uneasy, but that does not render them worthless. By the time a baby is born, it has the capacity to survive ? with suitable care ? away from the mother entirely: that surely gives it some greater claim to an independent right to life.
I had feelings for both of my children before they were born. I was protective of the very notion of them, and I examined their scans with pleasure. But something extraordinary happens at the moment of birth, when babies suddenly appear in the world in all their naked, elemental glory. At that moment, they assert themselves as human beings separate from their mother.
I do not know if Ms Minerva has children herself, but there is something about newborn babies that comes as a kind of joyful shock: their delicious ferocity in promoting their own survival. They might flaunt their vulnerability, with their silky skin and curiously heavy heads, but they still turn those heads to feed with a breathtakingly sharp and voracious instinct. They are bristling with the urge for life, although they might not be able to articulate it.
There is powerful meaning beyond logic, rooted in experience, instinct and love. And if you cannot understand that, perhaps you are still just a ?potential person? yourself.

Man rescued after months in snow-covered car

<post author="Chunder" datetime="2012-02-19T03:24:00" id="p1">
Wow... Just wow!

<a href="http://news.ninemsn.com.au/world/8422002/man-rescued-after-months-in-snow-covered-car">Man rescued after months in snow-covered car</a>

A man was pulled alive from a snowed-in car on a deserted forest road in northern Sweden where he had been stranded and without food for at least two months in freezing temperatures, police said.

"We received word yesterday (Friday) that a person had been found in a snow-covered car deep in the woods, more than 1.5 kilometres (nearly a mile) from the main road," Ebbe Nyberg, a duty officer in the northern Vaesterbotten county, told AFP.

A man on a snowscooter had noticed the top of the car on the deserted and snowfilled forest road, not far from the northern town of Umeaa, just south of the Arctic Circle, and after clearing off some of the snow had peered inside.

"He saw movement and realised there was probably a person in there and called the police," Nyberg said, adding that rescue services and an ambulance that had been belted to drive on the snow had rushed to the scene.

They were amazed at what they found: A man in his mid-40s huddled inside in a sleeping bag "in really bad shape," starving and barely able to move or speak

Nyberg said it was unclear exactly how long the man, who is from the central Swedish town of Oerebro, had been stuck, but pointed out that the car must have been driven to the deserted spot "before it began snowing in the autumn."

"He says himself he has been without food since December, so we think he must have got there around then, or perhaps earlier, in November," he said, pointing out that temperatures in the area have recently plunged as low as minus 30 degrees Celsius (-22 degrees Fahrenheit).

"It's just amazing he's alive!"

The man, who had not been reported missing and who has yet to say how he got stuck, appeared to have survived on nothing but snow since mid-December.

After his rescue, he was rushed to the Norrlands University Hospital, said Nyberg, who could provide no details on his condition.

AFAIK you can survive over two months on only water. Considering he probably did not engage in any physical activity (does cold also slow down the metabolism?) I can imagine this being pulled off. He probably wasn't a happy camper when they pulled him out, but I think it's within the realm of possibility.

If anything cold would increase metabolism as that is the only way he could have produced heat. I imagine he was pretty chunky or muscular in December. If he was a bean pole to start with he would not have made it. If the car was totally covered in snow that also helped him as the snow would have insulated him from sub zero temps. I would like to hear the rest of the story though.

If true,which is dubious, all I can say it's retard luck.The car was 20 minutes relaxed walking from the road,which even in remote parts of Sweden must see at least a forrest ranger at least once a week.With legs broken,it's still doable by crawling.A navy SEAL in 2005 crawled 8miles, IIRC, in Afghan mountains to friendly villagers,while hunted by the enemy.

This man had wood,gasoline and even rubber to make smoke observable from vast distances.

It might be a medical story,but a survival story ain't.

He sat in his car and occasionally rolled down the window to get snow. He was an idiot for having allowed himself to be buried in snow in the first place.

Having noted that he was buried under snow, perhaps he wasn't so cold. He has a sleeping bag, probably some winter clothing, buried under snow thus keeping him relatively insulated from the environment and in a car which keeps him dry. Temperatures in the car were probably fairly constant at a survivable level.

He encountered a snow storm, his car got stuck... he stayed in car (what else he could have done?) and got stuck himself. I do not know the region in this case, but I know that in Scandinavian mountains one can get well over a meter of snow in one snowstorm. Västerbotten borders the mountains nevertheless and according to Swedish weather forecast services they are right now having regional snowfall that could be up to 70 cm during 24 hours...

This is what it can look like on Norwegian side of the mountains:

A friend of mine has witnessed a snow storm that brought almost two metres of snow during one night in Norway.

In any case, considering the fact that he did not dig himself out, I think that he was either an idiot or simply too fat to get out via the window (which would also explain part of his ability to survive). A person with significant amount of extra weight shouldnt have trouble to survive for two months if the water supply is available and the physical activity is low.

From an other internet newsline, they detailed the fact that the car provided an "Igloo" effect maintaining a constant temperature. Doctors have said a person can survive without food for at least a month as long as they have water (that the snow would provide). They also said that the more overweight a person is, there is more body fat to provide nourishment if a person stays calm and goes into a hibernation state. Though he may come out looking like a "survivor" of a concentration camp, at least he can be proud of the fact he can buy normal size clothing on sale.

It is not unusual for vehicles (or even homes) to be totally buried quickly in a snow storm The location this person was in was just a few miles south of the Arctic Circle. I have seen some photos of June Lake, California that was a beautiful snow scene showing a heavy blanket of snow around the homes and businesses. Then it was explained to us by a resident that what we were looking at as homes was actually the top floors of two-story houses.

Ummm, wait a second while I recheck my memory.

Yup, that was June Lake. But it reminded me very much of one winter we had in Milwaukee in the late 1940's.

This happens in Oregon with regularity. People try "the shortcut" through the mountains, get stuck and wait for someone to blunder along and rescue them. Others get on the logging roads which fork a hundred times and goes into loops. Once the fog rolls in your screwed if you are even a little unsure of where you are at. Sometimes those trying to walk back are the ones that die while those that stay in the car survive. Then there is my favorite. A couple followed a GPS that needed upgrading. They turned off the main road and got hopelessly lost and stuck. You would have though the gravel road pealing off the main highway and going straight up the mountain would be a clue but no. You would think the heavy ruts that only a 4X4 belongs would be a clue but no. Their mini van can go anywhere..or so they thought.

As for this guy a lot can play into what happened. He may be a little slow in the head. He may have gone up there wanting to die. Could have had a minor stroke early on. Could have been sick then bounced in and out of mild hypothermia. Hopefully there will be a follow up.

For those of you who are doubtful about the dangers of deep snow and its sudden build up as well as its sudden changes of location, this just appeared on the internet news:

STEVENS PASS, Wash. — Three skiers were killed Sunday when an avalanche swept them about a quarter-mile down an out-of-bounds canyon at a popular resort, but a fourth skier caught up in the slide was saved by a safety device, authorities said.

The four were among three groups of skiers – about a dozen people in all – making their way through a foot and a half of fresh snow on the back side of Stevens Pass when the avalanche hit. Stevens Pass is in the Cascade Mountains, about 80 miles northeast of Seattle.

All were buried to some extent, but the men who died were swept approximately 1,500 feet down a chute in the Tunnel Creek Canyon area, King County Sheriff's Sgt. Katie Larson said.

Most of the other skiers, all well-equipped, were able to free themselves and rushed to dig out the victims. They performed CPR on the three men to no avail, Larson said.

The fourth skier who was swept down the mountain, a woman, appeared to avoid a similar fate because of the avalanche safety device she was wearing, Larson said.

Such devices include wearable airbags that can be deployed to help a person float atop an avalanche rather than being buried underneath it, or inflatable bags that create space between a person's mouth and the snow. It wasn't immediately known which kind the woman had, said Deputy Chris Bedker of the sheriff's search-and-rescue unit.

The men who died were believed to be in their 30s and 40s.

"Most of the people involved in this were well-known to the ski community up here, especially to the ski patrol," Bedker said. "It was their friends who they recovered."

Initial reports of the avalanche reached the sheriff's office just after noon, and for some time it wasn't clear whether the other skiers had also been swept up in the slide.

The Northwest Weather and Avalanche Center on Sunday issued a warning for high avalanche danger for areas above 5,000 feet, saying warmer weather could loosen surface snow and trigger a slide on steeper slopes. The elevation of the avalanche wasn't immediately clear.

At mid-afternoon, the temperature at the base of the Stevens Pass ski resort was 24 degrees, with light winds and good visibility. The temperature at the top of the mountain was 22 degrees, according to the resort's website.

John Gifford, the ski area's general manager, said Sunday that the resort had received 19 inches of snow in the past 24 hours.

Stevens Pass is one of the most popular outdoor recreation areas in the state, with visitors flocking to the scenic site to go cross-country, back-country and downhill skiing, as well as snowshoeing and backpacking.

It's been a deadly winter in Washington's mountains. Four people disappeared in vicious storms while camping and climbing on Mount Rainier last month. The four remain missing, and authorities have said they're hoping to find their bodies when the snow melts this summer.

Across the West, there had been 13 avalanche deaths this season as of Thursday, according to the Colorado Avalanche Information Center, which tracks avalanche deaths in the U.S.

Experts have said the risk of additional slides in the region could remain high all season. They attribute the dangers in part to a weak base layer of snow caused by a dry winter.

Avalanche deaths are more common in the backcountry than at ski resorts. Out of about 900 avalanche deaths nationwide since the winter of 1950-51, 32 were within terrain that was open for riding at ski resorts, according to the Utah Avalanche Center.

Also Sunday, King County Sheriff's Sgt. Cindi West said a snowboarder was killed in a separate incident at the Alpental ski area east of Seattle. The snowboarder, a man, went over a cliff.

Weather can change really quick in the mountains. You can go from a sunny day to a white-out and a foot of fresh snow in the space of two hours. Here in the Cascades, further, the proximity to the ocean means there's a lot of moisture that's never far away. The Cascades divide the wet west from the dry and cold east of Washington and Oregon. When that cold air collides with wet air, you get snow. Lots and lots of wet, heavy snow. Happens more the higher up you go. Too many high mountain skiers have been caught for days in a sudden storm and cut off from any help. Can't do anything for them until the weather breaks. Often, it's too late.

I think the coast range can be more dangerous in Oregon. Most people pack accordingly for trips over the cascades but many will take a coastal logging road to the coast on a whim. A lot of cold rain a bit of wind, a downed tree or mudslide and suddenly your stuck. Its in the upper 30's at night and all they have in the car is some old coffee and a candy bar....and they are soaking wet. Some of those roads won't see another vehicle until spring.

Mt Hood is a killer though. Mostly because it is too accessible from Portland so no one respects it like they should. Hood is so freaking inviting but when the SHTF you will find she stacked the deck against you. If you are not fully prepared and at least a little lucky, you can kiss your ass goodbye.

"The snowboarder, a man, went over a cliff." All too often they do it to themselves.

I remember the controversy when locator beacons and cell phones were being used. People would call 911 and say "I'm lost. help me". Yeah good luck with that. Beacons gave too much of an air of invincibility. People thought they can push the limits a bit more because if they get caught in an avalanche they would soon be found. Again there were some holes in that logic as well. Other people need to be nearby AND also have to have beacons. Then it would also have to be safe to come out in the slope to search for victims. SAR personal are trained to NOT go out and risk their lives if it is deamed too risky. Additionally, people simply do not realize what it is like to be in an avalanche. The force is tremendous. Many die long before the snow stops moving. Now to my point. I hope people don't look at the "life jackets/airbags" and think they can leave their brains at home because all this new technology can save them.

Man Shoots Daughter's Laptop

<quote>
By Sam Laird | Mashable ? 22 hrs ago

The disgruntled teenage daughter of a tech-savvy, gun-toting father just got a very public lesson in respecting one's elders.

"That right there is your laptop," the father, named Tommy Jordan, says in a YouTube video while pointing a video camera at a computer on laying in a patch of dirt and grass. "This right here is my.45," he says, moving a pistol into the frame.

He cocks the weapon and shoots nine exploding hollow-point rounds into the laptop.

Okay, rewind.

Jordan's 15-year-old daughter apparently wrote a Facebook post complaining about the chores she has to do at home and the overall hassle that her parents make her life. The father took exception to the public airing of grievances, and so decided to exact his own bit of public revenge, according to the video description, as well as Facebook and Reddit posts he appears to have made.

The role of social media in family life has been debated since social networks
began to catch on, but Jordan appears to be taking a proactive approach.

In the video, which is titled "Facebook Parenting: For the troubled teen." and looks to be shot from a tripod, Jordan sits down in a chair outdoors with a computer print-out in hand. He dedicates the recording to his daughter and, "more importantly for all her friends on Facebook who thought that her little rebellious post was cute, and for all you parents out there who think your, you know, kids don't post bad things on Facebook."

Jordan says he works in IT for a living (and, indeed, appears to run a company called Twisted Networx) and chastises his daughter for thinking she could hide the note from him with privacy settings. He then reads the purported note aloud after explaining, "since you want to hide it from everyone, I'm going to share it with everybody."

In the note, the daughter says that she should be paid for the chores she does and her parents overwork her, criticizing them harshly. Jordan says that her complaints are mostly unjustified, and contrasts it to the work he had to do growing up.

After about seven minutes of preamble, he gets up from the chair and plugs the computer full of lead.

Jordan writes in the video description: "Maybe a few kids can take something away from this... If you're so disrespectful to your parents and yourself as to post this kind of thing on Facebook, you're deserving of some tough love. Today, my daughter is getting a dose of tough love."

Mashable has attempted to contact Jordan for further comment, but so far has not received a response.

Do you think this is an effective use of social media in parenting? Appropriate or inappropriate? Let us know in the comments.

Heh, isn't this a bit over the top. Who EXACTLY is the teenager here <img src="http://www.worldaffairsboard.com/images/darksmiles/biggrin.gif"/>

Its his daughter for gods sake. There has to be any number of ways he could have handled this.

But no, he choses to use hollow point bullets to go postal on his daughters laptop. And then to top it films the episode &amp; makes it public. Should go down a treat with the in-laws.

Heh, isn't this a bit over the top. Who EXACTLY is the teenager here <img src="http://www.worldaffairsboard.com/images/darksmiles/biggrin.gif"/>

Its his daughter for gods sake. There has to be any number of ways he could have handled this.

But no, he choses to use hollow point bullets to go postal on his daughters laptop. And then to top it films the episode &amp; makes it public. Should go down a treat with the in-laws.

hmm, i dont think that would result in such an extreme reaction.

This guy's got a business. The economy's in the shitter, he's under pressure and he cracked. Thing is he doesn't realise it and putting it out there for the world to see might not have been the smartest move.

Used that as an example of what could drive a person to the edge. I dont know specificlaly if he is facing any financial troubles. What made me suspect it is he's in the computing business and yet he chooses to shoot - what- a computer. Business cant be doing all that well.

Why use hollow points instead of any other slug ? those are deadly they're supposed to break up and cause maximum damage,how many did he use, there's a lot of pent up rage here.

Laptops are quite fragile, drop one from a few feet and anything could break, as a computer guy he knows that very well, why not just smash it on the pavement, why shoot with a gun and then video it. Way over the top.

This guy is under pressure of some sort and that is clear.

I agree with some of what he did - but really - using a gun? - He should have sold the stupid laptop. I could never see using a gun in any parental discipline activity. If he sold the laptop, he'd have the money, his daughter would still be denied the laptop. But most importantly - he would not have done a public display like this - demonstrating that he uses a gun when something pisses him off. If he worked for me - he wouldn't after I saw this. While I doubt this, what if someone is concerned about him using the gun on his daughter? What if there is a custody claim between him and his X, wouldn't this video convince a judge that this girl would be safer somewhere else?

All I can say is that the father will get more than he bargained for and not necessarily in a good way. I would not be surprised if he gets a "surprised" visit from the social services and more interference with his parenting by outside agencies. Since he chose to make this publicly, he will find that the outside forces and the public will interfere or intervene with his parenting, and not to his liking.

My advice: hire an expensive lawyer. You are gonna need it.

I'd be interested in dividing the responses here by those who have raised children, and those who have not.

The lecture and the destruction of the laptop - they are fine, the point is made in an extraordinarily strong manner. The posting of all of this on the internet, the public sharing of dirty laundry - not fine, rather stupid in fact.

Family discipline should be kept within the family.

As for the use of a pistol... in this case, it was a tool like a hammer, no more, although admittedly one that makes a statement. Concerns that the Dad is some kind of danger is similar to concerns that simply because he owns a gun, he MUST be some sort of violent, creepy, and antisocial person.

A 1/4 lb of <a href="http://www.tannerite.com/">Tannerite</a> would have been even more impressive.

My only objection is the father posting this. He has taken himself down to her level of immaturity.

No, i'm not implying the bolded bit in any way whatsoever.

A person that acts out his emotions with a gun and in the manner it happened is the dodgy bit. You can draw a lot from that of which the most basic is will this person go berserk with it when he gets mad. He's already shown that he can.

What i find curious is people that supposedly are more level headed would actually defend this behaviour or see nothing wrong with it. You're actually doing yourself a disfavour by supporting gun rights for someone that has already shown themself to be emotionally unbalanced.

He should have used a hammer if he had to destroy the machine, it would have made his life much simpler. While many of us can see that he probably isn't a gun criminal, there are also many who can't or won't see the tool aspect of his gunplay. Overall, I see it as immature, ineffective and spooky the way he did this - he didn't do a good job of teaching his daughter - he started a war with her, and brought a gun. I suspect she will be leaving home soon, perhaps with a boyfriend.

I have two daughters, one is grown, successful and visits us regularly (a couple times a week), one is 11, lives with me and is very close - so I do understand about raising daughters, I have three youngers sisters and a niece too. Praise publicly, discipline privately have been maxims that always worked for me.

If he was "teaching" her - what lesson do the 1$ a round exploding bullets give?

Shooting the lap top may have been more for him than for her. Long ago I got to shoot a PC loaded with windows 95. God it felt good putting rounds in that POS that caused me so much grief. That day saved me years of therapy.

The other irony I saw in the video was that he mentioned the cost of the new software and the bullets like it was a bid deal, yet he had no issues ruining a lap top that cost much more. I was questioning if the lap top he shot really was his daughters or some DOA laptop that any IT person could have pulled from the garbage somewhere.

I am already feeling sorry for the boy. You know, the one that is going to fall in love with the daughter and end up having to deal with her and her father.

I've enjoyed destroying a problem computer before too, smashing one is quite an experience, shooting it would be good too, but busting it open has a special cathartic quality, dropping it off the building roof does a good job, and an 8# sledge hammer works very well.

I can't say with 100% confidence, but I think it is the opposite. It seems that he has been very involved as a parent. Things like the chores list... it is a lot easier to ignore the kid's responsibilities than to enforce a work schedule. The act of getting a typical child to do simple kid chores is harder than doing the chores yourself.

Almost every guy I've talked to who has raised both boys and girls say that "raising daughters is much harder than sons." I have to agree. Boys are relatively simple creatures, girls far more complex, and they all seem to go through a hormonal period between 15 and 18 where they go utterly brain dead and can be a handful.

I'm going through it now, though my 11 yo doesn't defy me - she just "forgets" a lot. I even find myself still teaching my 21 and 22 yo's some things, like how to make the right amount of spagetti - not just cook the whole package - and throw most of it away...

Still it has to be done, unless a helpless dependant is what is being raised. I pity the parent who settles for this.

I hope this "event" brought a head to the situation for that family and let out some of the bad stuff.

The onset of the "hormonal distractions" period in a young woman's life is a real challenge, being there everyday and listening and talking about these things does help. Even a brief break in this routine can be hard to recover from - In my experience. Sometimes the parent doesn't "win" every battle. I find that moving on, and trying to accomplish the necessary tasks another way is a valuable approach. Demonstrating flexibility and unconditional love, but still adhering to getting the required results. In my situation, I am the only functional parent, my daughter's Mother doesn't help much - I know that in a two parent family, the woman normally handles this role - but in our family - it fell to me to do this - and it is always interesting and rewarding when it works out. My kids are also very patient with me because of the situation.

Have to agree with those of you who think the father was wrong in the way he handled this. The biggest mistake a parent can make is stoop to the level of the kid when dealing with something like this, and he did big time. Using a gun was scary. What will he shoot next in the ongoing war with his daughter which is sure to continue?

My daughter--you can see her in my avatar--was difficult at times during her teenage years (now 20), as all teenagers are, and I was as a teenager, so I understand the father's frustration. But teenagers have a lot in common with their parents, and this father's action was probably a grown-up version of his daughter's attitude. What a waste of ammo.

The damage is probably done. In their teen years, girls and boys begin the natural process that leads to separation from the control of their parents. That's a good thing. While that process is going on, teenagers go through the motions of rejecting their parent's ideas and ways only to revert back to many of them unconsciously in later years when they have their own children.

sitting on the porch - cleaning the punt gun with a toilet brush attached to a broom handle, a can of brasso, some rags and a pile of 2 gauge - 10 oz, #4 shot shells laying around by his feet - mumbling about the agent orange and "those bastards"... "you wanna do what to my daughter" - reaching down and picking up one of the 8" long cartridges - he loads the banana sized shell in the punt gun - glaring at the boy... Brown stains appear on the seat of the boy's kahki slacks as he sprints towards his car - "come back here", the punt gun clicking loudly as the breach closes...

buyer claims vintage/pre-owned mink headband is dirty~help?

<post author="macsmarketplace" datetime="2012-03-09T00:04:00" id="p1">
Buyer received item on February 24 and tonight March 8 I got this message:
"I am sorry, but I just got around to opening the packed and it is alright but it is dirty.And it is to much for something that is dirty, to be putting on my head."
My listed states
"SOLD AS IS AND THERE IS NO RETURN"

Listing also states: it is vintage and pre-owned.
How is it dirty? It sounds like they think they paid too much for it.
What do I do now? I have 100% feedback and never had this happen before.

"How is it dirty? "

How is it not dirty?

A vintage used headband or hat is worn close to the head, and comes in contact with hairspray and cosmetics, it may also have accumulated a good amount of dust and dirt if it was not properly stored.

Did you take it to the Furrier and have it cleaned before you listed it?

Your " SOLD AS IS AND THERE IS NO RETURN" is trumped by Ebay and Paypal's buyer protection policies, so you do take returns and you do refund for a full 45 days after payment is received.

You can cheerfully refund upon return of item or

buyer can file SNAD, get their purchase price plus original shipping refunded by PP/ebay and you'll get a strike for having a disagreement filed.

btw - when you say "no returns' in listing, ebay considers that you don't want the item back and will refund without return of item.
</post>
<post author="meowkittykltty" datetime="2012-03-10T03:05:00" id="p6">
my rationale was explained quite nicely by Desdam. If buyer files a SNAD claim, Ebay will refund the buyer &amp; allow them to keep the item based on your no returns policy &amp; you likely will be negged by the buyer. It is far easier to refund after getting your item back than stand on principle &amp; be out the money and the item.

Pictures are a must. You should have them showing all aspects of the item. When I sold, I would use Photo Bucket to host them &amp; put them in the body of my listings.

<post author="meowkittykltty" datetime="2012-03-10T03:13:00" id="p7">
I looked at your hat listed. Were it mine, I would have pics of the veil spread out, close up of the top, inside, front, back &amp; sides as well as the tags.

The same for the figurines, inside, bottom, back etc. You want to describe your items as if there were no pictures and have pictures as if there were no description.

<post author="poopeyhead" datetime="2012-03-10T03:53:00" id="p8">
Excellent advice Kitty, but I would add that one can't depend on common sense of the buyer either, if a vintage item is not spotlessly clean as it would be in brand new condition then this has to be mentioned also. Just a few lines saying that vintage items may not be as clean or as unused as brand new would do it, as long as you have those pictures. This is what is known as full disclosure, anything else gives a buyer grounds for a return, and these days that is enough to see you refunding a lot. At least if you disclose any condition flaws then you can say it was fully disclosed in the auction and the buyer bid and purchased it knowing the flaws. That is the only defense I have ever known of to work in a dispute but even that is not going to work every time if it happens too often.

<post author="quiltgeek" datetime="2012-03-10T11:32:00" id="p10">
You're not understanding about providing pictures. You need MORE pictures, showing the front, back, sides, inside, close ups of any unusual or damaged sections.

Buying eBay's picture services costs money. You can provide the pictures yourself for free by uploading your pictures to any online picture storage site. Photobucket is a reasonable choice. You can use it for free, or pay a small amount to get more featrues and possibly faster loading time.

To use the photobucket pictures in your Description, switch to the HTML version of your Description and paste the html link photobucket provides under each picture.

Switch back to the Text version of the Description to check how the pictures fit in your listing.

Hello Everyone!!!

Shazza your welcome!!! That is a very pretty thank you tag. You can post old tags too. I post some old tags and some new. I haven’t made a new tag in 2 years, until the past week or two. I had to add backgrounds to the few old animations that I like. They don’t look right and the gray background on the board. Just have fun.

You girls are doing some wonderful tags.

You did another one, I think you used splash on the drop off for Rhonda on the other thread. Do you even remotely remember the settings?
It has been a long time away for me too.

Hi all.

(((((((((((Char)))))))))))))I am so thrilled you like it. I was afraid it would be to loud for you. Thanks, and your welcome. I snagged some knitting art, and have you in mind. Hope you don't mind.

(((((((((((((Rhonda)))))))))) So glad you like it. Your very welcome. You know your my favorite guinea pig, or however you spell it. When I try to use spell check, it times me out. <img src="http://forums.ebay.com/images/emoticons/cry.gif" alt=":_|"/>

((((((((((((((Lucky))))))))))))))) Thank you for the lovely compliments.
I have been playing with some filters I never used before. For Rhonda's tag I used Filter Factory N/ Diamond glass, and for Chars it was Visman Distortion Filter/ Gear. They are free filters.

I will try to remember where I got them, and post a link.

And yes I had to do this, just because I'm a bit warped.

OT--Great horned owls hooting up a storm!

<post author="canyon_wren" datetime="2012-03-09T01:33:00" id="p1">
I love coming to the MISC forum on ebay when my insomnia kicks in. Don't usually post, but this is such a friendly board, I thought I'd tell everyone how wonderful it is right now, to hear the owls calling for mates.

I am a wildlife biologist and even tho I know that now is the time that owls start mating/nesting, it's still really cool to hear the symphony of sounds outside my window!
</post>
<post author="meowkittykltty" datetime="2012-03-09T02:05:00" id="p2">
That is cool, I don't know that I have ever heard real owls make noise. I have seen some live owls with handlers &amp; they seem to not like me. One kept staring at me even as it's handler moved away from me. Owls are cool but I am afraid that if one had the chance it would bite me.
</post>
<post author="canyon_wren" datetime="2012-03-09T02:41:00" id="p3">
Hey Meow--

Yes, one of them would bite you!

All raptors, birds of prey, have very strong beaks and really strong talons. In the past I had to capture wild falcons and they do not like being captured!

What is so interesting right now is that the owls are doing their thing, hooting and calling and possibly (having sex?) mating, and most of us sleep through it.

<post author="bostongrammy" datetime="2012-03-07T06:29:00" id="p2">
Give the seller a couple of days to reply. If he does not, then if the envelope did not have any tracking or delivery confirmation, you can file a claim for "Item not received" (INR). If it does show a delivery confirmation, then file a claim for item "Significantly not as described" (SNAD).

hi,it had a delivery confirmation.not sure i understand your other option.i have saved the envelope with the usps sticker on it.never had this happen before,but it seems it must have occured to others.the guy did mail it and all,just didnt use good,common sense in putting a heavy pointed object in a paper envelope instead of a box.thanks again for any advice
</post>
<post author="bostongrammy" datetime="2012-03-07T09:06:00" id="p4">
If the Delivery Confirmation was scanned, then there's no point in filing a claim for 'Item not received" since the seller can show that something was delivered.

On the other hand, your item is invisible or missing, which is not as described. When a buyer files a SNAD claim, eBay will either issue a refund directly or might instruct the buyer to return the item for a full refund. You can ship your empty envelope back to him as a 3-ounce parcel with Delivery Confirmation for $1.64 (if you don't know how, just ask).

thehorseman1955,

As others have said you will not be getting your money back from the seller.

Your only option is to take the envelop, make a copy of the item (pic &amp; description) and head to your local Post Office. You might call first and set up an appointment to talk to the postmaster.

I know that many an item gets caught up in their machinery and it ends up in lost and found section. At, the end of a sort, they find empty enevelops and boxes and items. They just have no way of matching items and containers to each other. So, they will send the container on.

The post master, hopefully, will know the steps in getting your widget back to you. They might need some form of proof of purchase, that is why I say call first.

Best of luck to you.

If there was no Insurance on the package
Nothing the Postmaster can do

I believe others said that if the OP opens a SNAD claim,
They will get a FULL refund
Item price + what they paid for the original shipping and handling

went something like &gt;&gt;

HI, this actually happened to me. I bought a bottle of Avon lotion and the idiot seller put it in a yellow envelop. Well, the bottom split open and the bottle slipped out. I got an empty envelop.

Just file an item NOT as described through Ebay or paypal. If there is a section for a note,write that the envelop split open. The seller was a moron. He should've wrapped the entire envelop with tape to make sure that the item did not bust through. You will definitely get your money back.

This one is the seller's fault all of the way. From time to time, I do use an envelop but I always completely wrap all 4 sides with tape. I add enough tape to ensure that if the envelop splits, the contents will NOT slip out.
</post>
<post author="toybrats" datetime="2012-03-08T16:24:00" id="p9">
Anyway, I filed and the idiot seller never responded to my emails. So on the 7th day, I got my money. On the 8th day, I gave the moron a well deserved negative. Had she responded and at least apologized, I would NOT have posted a neg. Anyway, I am sure that the moron now knows how to pack an envelop.

Item: Digital Zapper AV9f by Hulda Clark, 300670276255
</headline>
<post author="rmhlunatic" datetime="2012-03-03T18:42:00" id="p1">
Seller vilmantasw86 ( Feedback Score Of 206), is selling an "appliance for killing viruses, bacteria, parasites and cancer cells" by Doctor Hulda Regehr Clark.

This sounds like a medical device and is not backed by any science to confirm the claims. In fact, Wikipedia indicates Dr. Clark was forced from the US to Mexico after being legally pursued by the FTC and FDA. In 2009, she died of cancer despite claims her methods, including this zapper, would cure all disease.

It doesn't seem possible to report this to eBay in a manner that allows comment. So, here it is. This device and seller need to be removed permanently.

Recently I have looked at a number of items and emailed the sellers questions....repeatedly in some cases and never got a response.... In 2 cases there was absolutely no way to contact the seller... How do sellers expect to sell items if they don't respond to emails... in years past this was never an issue and when I am a seller I make it a point to answer EVERY SINGLE email I receive... Is this a new trend ??

As you've figured out, some sellers have preferences set to not accept questions, and many just do not answer. Its their choice.

If you are uncomfortable bidding on or purchasing an item without further information, JUST HIT YOUR BACK BUTTON!

<post author="quiltgeek" datetime="2012-03-06T15:31:00" id="p4">
Also - sometimes the fact that the Ask Seller a Question is not on the listing can mean that you've been blocked from bidding. There are automatic blocks that can cause this.

Sellers can set blocks for locations they don't ship to. These can include entire regions of the world, specific countries or domestic destinations such as PO Boxes, FPO/APO addresses, Alaska, Hawaii or Puerto Rico,

Sellers can block for multiple UPI strikes or multiple reported policy violations

Sellers can blocks for not having a Paypal account linked to your eBay account (check this one, sometimes eBay accidently unlinks the Paypal account).

Sellers can block bidders who have one or more current bids on active listings or who have recently won one or more listings.

Sellers can block bidders whose Feedback rating is below zero.

If any of these apply to your account, you might be blocked for that reason alone.

If a seller does not reply to my question with in a reasonable time frame, I do not bid. If they don't have the time to answer, I don't have time to bid &amp; pay. If they simply can't be bothered, how do I know they will ship in a timely fashion?

I stoled this one from the wife so i could post here on the boards. Part of an old nickname her brother called her when growing up.

2 other are based on business name and the type of item sold

my oldest personal account is part of an old nickname too.

We were signing up for internet and at a loss for an email name. She suggested a pet's name and the girl thought feisty after the bird we had at the time. feisty was taken, so we became feisty1. When DH signed up for ebay, he used feistyone. When I started trying out selling, I stole it from him.
There are those who think it is appropriate.......

We shared this name on the boards for a while, but then he got a buying/posting ID.
I have a buying ID too, but am too lazy to post under it, so just behave myself on this one.

When I started on the boards they used your email address as your ID so i went by that for awhile. My account got hacked into in order to use my good feedback rating so i had to end up changing in ID. I like to buy and sell vintage baseball gloves and the term for those folks is "glover". I tried glover1 through glover9 and they were all taken so I tried to think of an obscure baseball term I could use and settled on fungo. A fungo is a type of bat used to hit infield and outfield practice. My playing number in high school and college was 8 so i am...........fungo8............but ya'll can just call me fungo.

Most of you may already know, but, here goes.....................

I AM a guy with an ID that one would think as female'

I do lawn care and one of my favorite plants is mexicam heather, which as it turns out, in retrospect probably ended up costing me 500$ because bees LOVE it and ended up with a hive in my garage which cost me 500$ bucks to remove, over 50K bees, largest the guy ever removed.

699 is where I live, close to route 69 in Muskogee OK, I thought heather 69 would give some people the wrong idea, so I added another 9, and still got an occasional remark for the ID.

Ya never know what's in a name, esp. on ebay!!!!

When I first started on Misc Board, I learned about posting ID's... The thread I posted in most was the local "bar" - posted in the bar frequently was an animation of three sets of eyes blinking in a hole in a brick wall (which I still use today) and people where always throwing peanuts at them. I thought, ' I need an ID, these poor guys need someone to stand up for them' so i became eitw-are-watching (eitw stands for eyes in the wall).

Because sellers are failing to file unpaid item disputes, giving him strikes, and/or are failing to use their Buyer Requirements option to block bidders who have excessive strikes.

<post author="quiltgeek" datetime="2012-02-22T15:03:00" id="p3">
Proven bad behavior is not shown in public on eBay. An eBayer who bids and refuses to pay will have UPI strikes on their account if the sellers they stiffed have filed and closed Unpaid Item claims against them.

If you sell, you should have the automatic blocks in the Buyer Requirements section of Selling Preferences set to protect your listings from proven deadbeat bidders and scammers.

Go to MyEbay &gt; Account &gt; Site Preferences &gt; Selling Preferences &gt; Buyer Requirements. I recomment setting the UPI strike block to 2 UPI strikes in 12 months.

OK, if it says NO CLAIMED that means that the email address is wrong OR the person did NOT register with PAYPAL yet.

You must immediately cancel the payment. Resend the payment if you have the correct email address. CHECK The status after you send the payment. If it says UNCLAIMED again, it means that no one is registered at PAYPAL with that email address. You can immediately cancel the payment.

See if you have the seller's email address. Email them directly and find out if they registered with PAYPAL.

Try and make contact with the seller. They are new and probably don't know what they are doing. Be nice. DO NOT POST A NEGATIVE.

See if they are selling stuff. If yes, then you know that their computer works. See if you can email them by asking a question on one of their items for sale.. Or you can also get the contact information and call them.

Don't assume that they are crooks.

Sounds like this is going to get a little complicated. There could be 100 different reasons. I use three different laptops for my ebay business. Two will work fine and then one won't.
The windows 7's work and the Vista won't.

So maybe you need to update Java. Download Secunia and it will tell you everything that needs updating.

Once when firefox updated I had trouble with ebay.

You could even have malware messing things up.

<post author="vermontproducts" datetime="2012-02-29T14:11:00" id="p1">
I sold an embroidery hoop (brand new) to a women a week ago. She emailed me today and said she received it but it is used and has scratches on it. She also said the hoop doesn't fit her machine. In the description, I listed the machine the hoop works with, so I asked her which machine she has. I assured her the hoop wasn't used and that we wouldn't have shipped out a damaged hoop. The only things I can think of is the package was damaged by the postal service during shipping (but that doesn't explain the hoop not fitting), she is lying (possibly a bate-and-switch scam), or she made a mistake and got the hoop for a machine that she doesn't own, so she is trying to blame me for that.

I am going to give her money back, but it makes me mad that this is happening. I do things right on ebay, I know how important it is to receive good products, so i try very hard to make what i ship out the best it can be. i have my main account plus this one that has only 3 ratings so far. if she leaves bad feedback, can i dispute it? this isn't in any way my fault. I ship products safely with lots of bubble wrap.

i can assure you (as readers) as well that the product was brand new and not damaged when it left my home. do i have the responcibility to return the money? please let me know what you think!

Well, I don't think it is a bait and switch. Because your items don't sell for hundreds of dollars the way a Laptop would---for instance. So why would she take the risk of sending ou back a different prorduct?

She MIGHt be hoping to intimidate you into giving a refund without a return---because your feedback is so low---she may think you inexperienced---and do not know the rules.

You can of course, require a return at her expense---but that may well result in a Negative. It's too bad we can't look at her buying History---but you said she is new.

You can really drive yourself nuts trying to figure out her motivation for what she's saying.

Its easier to just say 'return for refund' and then move on and not worry about it until you receive the item back.

What's this 'customer''s feedback score?

Are there any indications of previous hassles with other sellers?

Ask her if the package appeared to be damaged or anything to that effect.

I once purchased a dress and for whatever reason, the package didn't get me on the first attempt. After several exchanged messages, the seller sent it again, and by this time the outside package appeared to be cracked and bent; but the dress was intact.

So I guess I was lucky on that occasion.

She claims the item is used (which it isn't) and that it doesn't fit her machine. She told me which machine she has and it isn't listed in the description. She said she is keeping the hoop and selling it to her friend (can't be that badly damaged if her friend wants it!)

She left neutral feedback and said the item wasn't as described. It was EXACTLY as described. She didn't read the description.

She probably won't reply to my email. At leats neutral feedback doesn't hurt my rating.

Even if the damage wasn't my fault? Any damage she claims happened in shipping.

She left neutral feedback. She keeps making different claims. The first was the item was used, second it was scratched, third it didn't fit her machine. The item was brand new, any damage occured during shipping, and she should have read the description before buying.

She probably won't reply to my last email. There's nothing I can do at this point, however I will reply to her feedback.

I was in mail order for 25 years and think people put far too much faith in Feedback. I've got several hundred Feedbacks. So far I've got 100 pos., but I fully expect to get an occasional negative along the way. Likewise, I don't care if a person I deal with has a couple of negatives. So long as they aren't for dishonesty.

You can get negatives reversed. I've done it. Just keep all your e-mails &amp; other paperwork and tell the truth when you dispute any negatives. So long as it appears you made every effort to treat the customer right you shouldn't have any trouble getting it reversed.

I tried looking for the thread but was in a hurry to get to bed so I'll just post this in the hopes that whomever sent me my box reads the title!

The reason I was asking is that DH got some soap from that exchange. Whomever sent the package had a sister I think that made the soap. DH loves it and wants to order more but tonight was trash night and the label from the soap accidently got thrown away!

The soaps came in a cellophane bag with a wooden tray for the soap to sit on and each had a paper label. The soaps were oval in shape but flat and had a white paper label with the contact info.

If this sounds familiar, please contact me through our auctions! I'd love to buy more soap!

Dandy, I remember when we were talking about making soap. There is a gal who makes creams and soaps, and I will remember her name. She had a baby who was a preemie, and all of us prayed for that dear baby to survive.

She did survive, too and I'm just blanking on her name, but someone will know who I'm talking about. Barri will know for sure.

I think her nickname was or is lala or something like that. She had her own thread about the baby and gave us near daily updates.

Glad you ladies figured it out, because DH and son cleaned off my computer table and threw away all my notes. Drives me crazy, because when we do this years exchanges, I won't remember who had who. Everybody is going to have to let me know who they had, so I won't give them the same person. lol

One year, I got the same lady over and over again in the exchanges. We had nothing in common and I knew she wasn't happy about the things I sent her, so thank goodness I got to keep trying. lol

Oh, this thing with the guys throwing things out.! My dh is a fiend when it comes to stuff like that.

He has thrown away so many things that were important notes to me. He's so fastidious he will tear a page of a tablet out if something is written on it because it's been used.!

It's been used by me, and I wanted to keep that page. My memory is terrible, too, so I write notes for a reason.

When we were doing the making soap thread I was telling about when my current hobby was making soap. My soap was made with lye.

I made some soap, and it worked just great, but, I was so afraid of the process where you pour the lye in cold water that I quit making it. The lye would get so hot the cold water would start to act like it was boiling. The fumes were bad, so I would put it far away from anything.

Ah, I have had so many hobbies, and so much fun with them.

Now I just buy my soap, but, really my sd sends me the hard milled soap from paris. Spoils me a little bit.

hi shelley! i'm bear,with the coconut allergy.
the first symptom is that my forehead starts to itch,then my lips start swelling.when that happens it's off to get an adrenaline shot,or i get hives inside my throat and it closes up.
i almost died when i was 18 because of this.thankfully i was in the hospital already,had just had my appendix out. i ate an almond joy,and within about ten minutes i was swallowing convulsively,my lips wer gigamtic,so was my neck. i couldn't breathe at all,and they forced a tube down my throat which a nurse breathed into. i went into mild convulsions until the adrenaline kicked in,then they gave me some kind of wasp venom antidote.
this happened 4 times over a year,until they figured out what the allergy was. unfortunately,i am now lethally allergic to any wasp or bee sting,i have an epi for that,but i can't get an adrenaline epi.
i'll contact you soon,if you think you could use olive or maybe peanut oil? no nut allergies,trhanks be,or i'd be allergic to myself,lol!

Hi Bear,

I found 2 recipes. One with olive, canola &amp; castor (which really helps it suds) It calls for shortning for a 'filler' oil. Do you know if shortning ever has coconut oil? I can try reading the label but don't know if it'll be much help.

The second has olive, castor, cocoa butter &amp; again shortning. Most any recipe I find online will have added shortning b/c it's a relatively cheap 'filler'.

I know I could make my own with a little research but it might end up costing more depending on ingredients. Soybean is good but isn't much different than olive oil. The coconut helps make a harder bar so I'd like to find something that has that property. who wants a bar that washes down the drain??? LOL I look into peanut oil too.
</post>
<post author="sineaterdoodah" datetime="2012-02-26T10:22:00" id="p38">
shortening would be fine,it's vegetable based.soy is also fine for me,i'm not allergic to it.
i wonder if lard would work?
</post>
<post author="imabeliever1126" datetime="2012-02-27T11:29:00" id="p39">
Lard &amp; tallow (beef) are both cheap additives if you can find them. I'd have to check with our local butcher shop and see if it's available. They tend to be drying so if you already have dry skin I'd stay away from them. If not we could always add something to counteract it...olive oil is a great one and soy if very much like olive.

Do you want me to go ahead and make a batch? My usual recipe makes 8# but since this will be a new recipe I'll try to make it a couple of pounds at first to make sure it's something you can use...and like. How would you like it scented? Floral, fruity, citrus, other?

do you have any ethnic shopping close by,like an asian market or a bodega? or a walmart? all carry lard,i find the best price at the bodega,i get a 12 pound bucket for about 8 bucks.
tallow i get from my local restaurant supply,or the asian market,it's a bit more expensive( i'm a chef,who is SO not PC,when it comes to fats,lol!).
nope don't have dry skin except callouses,so i think any of your choices would work for me.

We are dairy farmer in the country...the closest thing for me to check is the local butcher shop...which I happen to be passing tomorrow. If no luck I'll have to get you to ship it to me for that price!!! We do have WalMart but never noticed lard...but then again I wasn't looking LOL

BTW...do you have any Indian markets near you? I'm looking for Amla aka Indian Gooseberry as a natural treatment for my dibetes. I'd like to try the powder or the dried berries themselves.

As for scenting the soap, I use mostly essential oils which are all natural. Not that you couldn't be allergic to them, but chances are the cosmetic fragrance oils would be worse. I'm going to try a small batch and scent it 'Hint Of Rain'. This is rosewood &amp; lemongrass but reminds me of the smell as a rain storm is blowing in.

Why do sellers mark up their items to prevent return?! Whats the point!
</headline>
<post author="sonatural1982" datetime="2012-02-29T06:18:00" id="p1">
I've been a seller on eBay for probably around 5 years, before all of my email accounts, bank account, and my ebay acct., among others, were hacked by someone in Australia. I primarily sold, and honestly never really paid too much attention to other sellers practices, and how they sell their items etc...After all the hoopla with my accounts, I decided to open another ebay account, but not really to sell, at least not at the volume I used to. So now that I buy mostly on eBay, Ive noticed that a LOT of sellers mark through tags on clothing, luggage, purses, even SHOES to "prevent the buyer from returning the item to the retail store". Can someone PLEASE tell me the point in this frivolous action?

Most stores dont operate like Walmart, randomly giving out returns for items that are ages old and without any kind of proof of purchase. Most stores will not even give you a return without some kind of receipt, and if they do give you a refund, its for the "present" value, which wont be worth it to the person whose trying to return an item. You mark up items that 9/10 will not be able to be returned to the store, and more importantly, WHO CARES IF THEY TRY AND RETURN IT TO THE STORE?? How is this a reflection on the seller if the person who BIDS and WINS, AND PAYS for an item you had up for auction meanders to their nearest N.M or wherever to tries and return something? High end stores in no way are going to return an item that does not have a receipt. Try taking a Burberry bag to the nearest store w/o a receipt, and see if you have any luck returning it. It aint happenin. So why the helk would you intentionally mark up beautiful clothing and shoes or luggage with a big black permanent marker because you somehow, heroically, want to try and prevent some pathetic person who is going to try and make a few more bucks then what they paid for the item by returning the item? It doesn't make any sense, and honestly, for me, it makes me not want to buy their items when I see a huge permanent marking slashed trough beautiful leather tags...it makes no sense. I could understand if eBay was like Etsy, where every item is "supposedly" an original, and buyers attempt to resell it as their own. That's a whole different story all together. But for me to mark through a $700 pair of Burberry shoes, so I can prevent the person who paid $550 for it at my store from returning it, makes not a lick of sense. Who are you trying to protect? Burberry..or whoever? Yeah, I think there good without your "assistance".

Sellers out there, PLEASE tell me why do this. WHY?..there has got to be a better explanation from someone than "we are trying to prevent buyers from trying to return items that multi-gazillion dollar retailers made so they can attempt to make a few more dollars than they paid for it in my store." See how ridiculous that sounds?

High end stores in no way are going to return an item that does not have a receipt.

Most of the high-end stores around here do accept returns without a receipt. They will give you a mechandise credit or an exchange card, not cash.

I've never encountered a listing where the seller marks the tags but I have purchased some items that were marked before they were in the seller's possession.

Why is it so very important?
</post>
<post author="fuzzface50" datetime="2012-02-29T06:51:00" id="p3">
It's not the sellers. It's the retailers that drop the stuff off at goodwill or some other place, so they don't get it returned back to them.

During the Christmas season, I sometimes help out at the Target distribution center for 6 to 7 weeks. Anything that falls off the conveyor belt is automatically put in a goodwill pile just in case it got damaged inside. We then mark GW 2 or 3 times over it and/or either run a line thru the barcode or cut it off completely, depends on the item.

Walk in any thrift store around here that got clothes from a regular store, the tags are all crossed out.

<post author="sonatural1982" datetime="2012-02-29T06:58:00" id="p4">
Whether we say high end stores will take it back is here nor there. I dont know the return policy of every store, and Im sure most dont. The ones I have dealt with are not taking back merchandise not purchased from there store without full documentation and proof of purchase. Its so very important because I dont want to spend hundreds of dollars on an item only to have it slashed up with black permanent marker. It takes away from the item. Yeah, It matters. If others want to spend a bunch of $ on items and have it marked through, then that's their prerogative. Im not one of them, and Im sure Im not alone.

Do you leave the tags on the item when you wear/use it?

<post author="feistyone" datetime="2012-02-29T09:05:00" id="p6">
The manufacturer often requires liquidation merchandise be marked or the label cut/cut out before it can be resold. Nothing the seller can do about that.

Although many stores have tightened their return policies, at one point some would take back just about anything no matter how worn and without a receipt. That is why the requirement was put in place and I think it just stands to this day.

I try to mention if I have something that has been marked or the label cut, but not all sellers do. If it is that important to you and the seller doesn't say, just ask them. That way you'll know.

Ebay is a secondary market, not retail, so there is no point in trying to buy things on here that you can return to a retail store for a full value refund. Retail stores mark through the original tags on items they are selling at clearance or donating, this is done to show the item is no longer being sold at full price and to prevent exactly the practice your talking about, which is someone paying very little on the secondary market and then getting a full value refund on that item by returning it.

So, let me get this clear, your mad because you cant' rip off retail sellers by returning items you buy on Ebay for full value? Wow!

You are not allowed to do that per eBay policy

<a href="http://pages.ebay.com/help/policies/item-location.html">Policy overview&gt;&gt; LINK</a>
Sellers must be clear and accurate about the location their item will be shipped from. We don't allow false, inaccurate, or misleading information about the location of an item in the Item location field or description.
Also, if there is a location stated in the item description, it has to match the location in the item location field.
Make sure your listing follows these guidelines. If it doesn't, it may be removed, and you may be subject to a range of other actions, including limits of your buying and selling privileges and suspension of your account.

I find it very annoying when I don't know where a product is coming from and if there are two identical items listed, all things equal, I will buy from the one who lists the town/city. BTW, I live "near Fort Collins."

And plus, if someone is searching by distance, it will come up last...

My 2 cents.
